"(Edit: My view has been change though there is still some interesting stuff in here) First I want to state that my opinion doesn't lead me to hate or judge transgender people, I simply want to understand their thought processes. In my opinion there is no reason to change genders. I believe that the genders are equal in every way (except biological and physical differences of course) so why change genders. For someone to say that they feel that they are a certain genders, associates feelings with genders. That leads to interests and emotions being tied to genders, and slowly leads society to have gender roles be popular again. many people I know have disagreed with me however none has changed my mind before I hope someone here can.

"I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. If I hadn't been able to get a 100k loan, I wouldn't be 100k in debt right now. I would've gone to a state school, and eventually appreciated that fact once I became more emotionally mature. Parents have a hard time letting their kid get a tattoo, but they let you get a HUGE loan on what is right now a big gamble? Please.

Now, why is that relevant? Well, the economy IS doing well right now, but who exactly is in charge? A bunch of people who the future economy won't affect in the slightest. Since a large majority of millenials are bogged by debt, we can't afford to properly flourish the economy like we want to. The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting to be more poor. Someone's going to get fucked.

Technology is rapidly advancing, and many of the low-income jobs new grads have been forced to take are about to become obsolete. As there is no general income implemented yet, a LOT of people are about to be broke. The only really essential jobs will be things automation can't accomplish, e.g. unpredictable jobs. Almost any job in existence will likely eventually be run by a machine, I can't think of one that can't, there are factories in Japan that do maintenance on themselves.

As an American, I don't know much about other nations, as school taught me exactly jack shit about them, but I have to wonder if they're in a similar boat. The model on which our economy is built rapidly becomes more out of date every minute. Eventually we WILL have to make changes, and I doubt those in power at the time will have the competence or open mindedness to do so.

Of course, none of this mindset was helped by [this book](http://www.epi.org/publication/failure-by-design/).

Please, PLEASE someone change my view. I really don't want to live in this country if I'm destined to end up homeless after defaulting on my loans.

Any ideas?

"Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for “sleeping around"", and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. 

I want to make this point clear – I am NOT debating whether or not it is good/bad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of ""slut."" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified.

The reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care of/raising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation.

Given these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. 

Once again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction.

To illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue.

Now, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination.

The difference between Bob and Patrick is this – Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over $5 billion from his father's trust fund.

So, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieve/accomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse.

Now, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biology/sociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios. I could be wrong on this, but it's more of an ancillary point rather than my main argument.

To make sure that you've been reading all the way down to the bottom, I would really appreciate it if you started your post with any word that rhymes with ""crime."" 

Thanks!!!

"So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to argue otherwise (for some animals it is very easy to read their emotional state), but I won't argue that because I think the whole idea that consent would be necessary in these situations is completely inconsistent with how animals are treated by the vast majority of our population, including vegetarians.

Example 1(for the vegetarians, but applicable for everyone): Pet ownership. Do we get consent when we take a puppy from his parents? Do we get consent when we neuter them? If you assume that consent is essential in animal/human relationships, pet ownership itself becomes a kind of slavery or imprisonment. The owner provides food and housing, the pet is imprisoned and provides entertainment to the owner. Any argument you could run about this being justifiable without consent would frighteningly similar to arguments for why slavery in the U.S. was good for many of the slaves. Arguments that they ""seem happy,"" or ""they don't run away"" are meaningless when you have kidnapped an animal and brought it up to be dependent on you. I'm not saying pet ownership IS slavery; I'm saying that the only way it pet ownership can be justified is if you toss out the idea of needing consent for our interactions with animals.

Example 2(for the carnivores): The vast majority of human beings eat animals. If you are one of this majority, the idea that you would ask an animals consent for anything is laughable. You could argue that unnecessary cruelty is still wrong, but much beastiality clearly involves the pleasuring of the animal, not the torturing of it. And regardless, arguments against cruelty have nothing to do with ""consent.""

So that's my basic argument. Come on reddit, change my view!

Edit: Changed zoophillia to beastility since zoophillia does not necessarily involve actual sex with animals. 

Edit 2: Just to clarify, I think bestiality is both disgusting and morally wrong. I think that cruelty to animals is wrong. This CMV is not ""convince me that bestiality is wrong"" or ""convince me that bestiality hurts animals""; it is ""convince me that consent is a relevant concept when applied to animals.""

1. We don't require an animal's consent for being kept as a pet, nor for eating it or consuming its milk, so consent is not relevant to human-animal interactions;
2. Sex is just another human-animal interaction;
3. Hence consent is also not relevant to humans having sex with animals, aka bestiality.

Clearly (1) is true, and (3) is a simple logical inference. But the weak point in your argument is (2), i.e., your assumption that there isn't anything special about sex.

In actuality, there are some things that are special about sex, in particular in regards to consent. We are ok with an adult playing basketball with a consenting minor, or forcing a minor to go to school even without consent, but we are not ok with an adult having sex with a minor in any situation. In other words, there are things adults can do with children that do not require their consent (forcing them to go to school) and there are things we do not consider children to be able to consent to in any situation (sex), even though the majority of adult-child interactions are guided by consent (playing basketball).

The argument could then be made, that animals are a parallel to children. Animals can be forced to do some things without their consent, like keeping them as pets or eating them for food, which would parallel adults forcing children to go to school. We don't require consent in those areas. And there are some things that we just do not consider animals to be able to consent to, and are therefore forbidden, namely sex, which would be a direct parallel to sex with children.

Now, you make a fair point that there might be a form of inconsistency here - why is it ok to ignore consent in some areas, and not in sex? However, the same potential inconsistency exists in society's treatment of children, and not just in society's treatment of animals, so if there is an inconsistency (debatable) it is at least one which society applies in a consistent way between animals and children.
","&gt;  I'm saying that the only way it pet ownership can be justified is if you toss out the idea of needing consent for our interactions with animals.

You're taking a lot of liberties where society does not.  We do throw out the concept of consent for ownership, but not for *everything*.  In fact it's fairly common for one person to break into another person's car if a pet is locked in without ventilation.

Here you are merging the concept of animals as pets and animals as food.  While in many cases the animal is the same, the relationship is starkly different.  It would be like saying that humans are ok with other humans being beaten nearly to death because we all know that it happens in torture scenarios.  There are corner case scenarios which allow for a set of behaviors but that does not mean that they can be extended to everything.

"In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me. I was born here in the US but I am of Chinese and Thai descent. As a child I grew up not really caring at all about race, I just sort of assumed humans came is all different colors and shapes and that was normal. I didn't even know there were names for the different races and ethnicities. The only thing I was really aware of was if people actually came from a different country.

As I grew older, my classmates and I were bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else. We were taught that white people were somehow inherently racist. We were taught that everyone else was perfect and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified. I started to see lines forming. White kids were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did. Black kids were taught that they were owed something. I noticed kids start self-segregating. It wasn't anything dramatic, no one attributed this to the things we were being taught, but people knew they were different now. 

I grew older still. I started paying attention to the news and the internet,. Race was discussed alot. I learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil. If you didn't know, Asians are hurt the most by affirmative action. I would need a MUCH higher SAT score and GPA than a black person to get into the schools of my choice. I started to resent black people for this. Why was I being hurt because an entire race was apparently performing poorly and my entire race wasn't? And if discrimination was the reason, well my race was discriminated against in the past too! This was opinion shared by my friends. It led us to think that if this was the case, black people didn't try very much and were lazy in school. Otherwise why would they need help? I was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and wasn't even close to the top of the class was accepted into my first choice college while I was not, despite my excellent grades and test scores. When I went to college, I made sure to avoid going to black doctors and other black professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences.

I learned about the black crime rate, and prison population. I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the streets. All the commentary about how this was racist merely solidified my opinion. I saw how violent black neighborhoods are, I was catcalled constantly by black men in the streets, I worked in a leasing office and saw black tenants who lived entirely off the government and complained about everything. If I hadn't heard about race my entire life I would have written all these off as ""Man those specific people suck"" rather than lump the entire race together. People address these issues as if everyone else is to blame for these peoples actions, instead of saying hey, those are just bad people. Instead they make it a race thing where those bad people are actually VICTIMS. I heard about the police shootings and the publicity around them. I heard about the riots, and the more people talked about how the senseless destruction was justified the more I distanced myself and the more scared I became. I started to involuntarily see black people as a threat. My friends all secretly talked about how they wished all these people would go back to Africa so we could all live in peace. In the past couple years after all the discussion about race I have seen SOO many non-black people become essentially racist, and so many wonderful black people become entitled and vitriolic.

So basically, I feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans, rather than african-american, asian american, etc, racism would soon become a thing of the past. If we keep bringing up race in EVERYTHING, kids start drawing lines and lumping people together as their race, rather than as Americans. They start noticing and being hyper-aware of differences between races. Crying racism in every situation just annoys people and defeats the goal of ending racism. Racial and diversity programs make people resentful, and make the benefitting parties feel entitled. People should be chosen on merit alone. ""Not seeing color"" is treated as ignorant and is laughed at, but I feel that this is the best way to operate if we are ever going to solve our problems.

I'd like other opinions on this because the way I see the world right now truly sickens me. I don't want to keep feeling like I am different because I am Asian, I want to feel American and be okay with the way people talk about race. I want to feel okay with the way we as Americans are dealing with these issues. I also want to understand why ""not seeing color"" is ridiculed.","While disappointing, I cannot say your view is unique here on reddit or anywhere else in the country, so I'm glad you're here on CMV.

&gt; &gt; As I grew older, my classmates and I were bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else. We were taught that white people were somehow inherently racist. We were taught that everyone else was perfect and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified. I started to see lines forming. White kids were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did. Black kids were taught that they were owed something. I noticed kids start self-segregating. It wasn't anything dramatic, no one attributed this to the things we were being taught, but people knew they were different now.
&gt; &gt; 

Could you provide examples of this? As someone who is black, I was never taught that I was ""owed"" anything. I was also never taught that all white people are responsible for the hideous injustices of the past.

&gt; I grew older still. I started paying attention to the news and the internet,. Race was discussed alot. I learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil. If you didn't know, Asians are hurt the most by affirmative action. I would need a MUCH higher SAT score and GPA than a black person to get into the schools of my choice. I started to resent black people for this. Why was I being hurt because an entire race was apparently performing poorly and my entire race wasn't?

While I am not a supporter of AA, it is often a misunderstood policy.

Pretend you have 2 little league football coaches:

Coach 1 takes over a team that was 2-12, and at the end of the season has a score of 8-6

Coach 2 takes over a team that was 7-7, and at the end of the season that is 10-4

I want to hire the most qualified coach. If I just look at what their current seasons were, I would have to go with Coach 2. Coach 2 clearly has a superior record to Coach 1. However, is Coach 2 really more qualified? 

Coach 1 obviously had to begin with a *much* worse team than Coach 2. If I honestly want the best coach, it would be foolish not to take that into account.

The idea behind AA is that we take into account peoples starting positions. This is where the confusion is. If an average white kid gets a score of 1980 on the SAT, and an average black kid gets a score of 1800, the argument isn't that the less qualified black person should get the spot. The argument is that the black student ***is*** the more qualified student. The idea is that we can't just look at the test scores in a vacuum, and that if the black student was raised in the same circumstance, they would have scored much higher.

The reason to not support AA isn't because it hurts the students getting passed over, but because it often hurts the students being let in. Even if we concede that a black kid being raised by a single mom working 2 jobs is at a supreme disadvantage, if we let that kid into an advanced school, it still doesn't change the fact that they don't have the skillset to be able to perform in that environment. Being a good student is learned behavior, and it is very unlikely this kid was taught how to be a good student. They simply won't be able to perform, no matter how smart they are, due to their upbringing.


&gt; And if discrimination was the reason, well my race was discriminated against in the past too! This was opinion shared by my friends.

Asians certainly delt with discrimination in the US. However, the discrimination faced was far less severe and couldn't have as large an effect on their population. This is due to most Asian Americans voluntarily coming here, meaning you have a *very* significant selection factor going on. To put it bluntly, most asians already came here with marketable skills(otherwise they would never have made it here). When you have marketable skills, discrimination is far less effective a means to harm people. Here is a good video explaining this:

https://youtu.be/Eu_bKJ11O0M?t=3m23s


If you no longer want to go to black professionals because of this, that's your business. But I feel the need to remind you that getting into the college doesn't net you a degree. You still need to pass the classes and graduate, and black students don't get AA while professors are grading their exams.

&gt; I learned about the black crime rate, and prison population. I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the streets.

You need to be careful with how you interpret statistics. The reason that most people will charge people who cite these statistics racist is because they are usually trying to cite them to present a narrative of the black thug, and do very little to interpret any statistic honestly. Here is a related example.

Imagine you have a small asian town in California that kidnaps people that pass by and cannibalizes them. They do this for an entire year, kidnapping around 50 people.

When they're caught, and then convicted of this heinous act, later that year I release a headline:

**98% of all cannibalism cases committed by asians**.

This would be a true statement statistically. Since cannibalism is a very rare crime, this town would responsible for almost 100 percent of the cannibalism cases. However, this is disingenuous to say the least. Me presenting the headline in that manner suggests that asians everywhere are to be feared. Seeing an asian in Vermont might cause people to be cautious that that person would eat them. By printing it I would *knowingly* be spreading misinformation, while technically not telling a single lie.

As for the black crime rate, most of it is concentrated in very specific high crime areas. You could look at the murder rate the same way we looked at cannibalism. It is, when dealing with a country of 330 million, a rare crime. In 2013 there were about 14,000 murders total. If half of those were black males, that is *still* only 7000. If we are **generous** and say all those murders were committed by unique individuals, we still have 7000 males out of how many millions? This means that 99.9% of black people you  meet have never killed anyone, and will never kill anyone. Sure, you could say that for other races it is 99.99, or 99.999, but 0.01 is still an infinitesimal amount of people no matter how you slice it. To top it off the bulk of these murders can again be traced back to about a dozen or so places. Most of them dealing with drugs. The idea that black people are just running around killing everyone is a myth. To make it more personal, has any black person ever put their hands on you? Assaulted you? Murdered someone you know? My guess is no, and it will probably never happen.

Another common misconception seen on reddit is ""black people kill white people like 10 bajilliion times more than white people kill black people."" Technically true, but misleading. Let's leave out the fact that gross population differences will screw with these numbers, as this post is long enough as is, and just stick with the same line of reasoning as before. In 2013, the amount of whites murdered by blacks was around 350. Not 350,000, not 3500....350. If you're white in this country the chances of a black person killing you is essentially zero percent. You're 10 times more likely to die of food poisoning, and how often are you worried about that?

&gt; So basically, I feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans, rather than african-american, asian american, etc, racism would soon become a thing of the past

It's odd that you say this, while admitting earlier that you're a racist. Racism cannot be solved by simply ignoring it. If you think it can, then indulge me with examples of *any* problem with society that was changed through people ignoring the problem. I'd be surprised if you could give me a singe example.","Most people who have some privilege (whether that be class, race, gender ect.) grow up in a bubble to some degree or another. We think that the world is in basically good shape, and that since we don't have obvious problems like Jim Crow or men stoning their wives, social justice has basically prevailed to the most reasonable extent.

If you're a women, it doesn't take long for that bubble to be popped. You will probably feel that you're systematically treated differently from men, and in many cases, treated worse. If you're black, you'll probably feel that you're treated differently than other races, often times much worst. If you're poor, -and so on. In your case, it was obvious that that asians are treated differently than other people. It's a cruel perversion of reasoning when the stereotype that ""asians are smart"" is used to disenfranchise them.

These bubbles don't pop all at once though, what if your on the other end of one of the many inequalities society presents? What if you happen to be middle class, or white, or cis or male? A lot of times it's the same thing. We come out of childhood and realise that ""Oh shit, society is still kinda fucked. We should probably do something about this."" And, that's uncomfortable, but kind of necessary.

Our default reaction to questioning the way we live is usually, anger, annoyance, or disbelief. We don't want to think about fact that the lifestyle we've been living all our lives *might* be contributing to massive social harm. We're scared of being a bad person. Which is understandable. In the bubble, we believe we're a good normal person.

You can be a good person outside of the bubble. Even if you're going to involuntarily profit off of some parts of a broken system for the rest of your life, you can still define yourself by your actions and not the circumstances of your birth. But that takes some seriously uncomfortable internal debate. You have to seriously think about what is not okay in the world, and what you're going to do about it. It's a lot easier to say fuck you to who ever brought all this up and stay in your bubble.

Example, few people like to think about whether eating meat is wrong. We just say, meat is NORMAL, why are we even TALKING ABOUT THIS? It's not like it's impossible to have a debate about whether eating animals is okay, and still come out of that thinking meat is fine to eat, or at least, that you're not necessarily a bad person for doing so. But we'd rather not even entertain the possibility.

So if we all stay in our bubbles and indeed school our children to do so, is institutionalized racism against asians ever really going to end? If we can't even debate whether or not things like racism exist in the world, how can we hope to be on the right side of it?

If this reasoning helped at all, it's mostly paraphrased from [Why Are You So Angry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExEHuNrC8yU). The video is a lot more eloquent than I am.

As one last note on the topic of affirmative action, and reverse racism generally. It's possible for a black privilege and a white privilege to exist simultaneously. That doesn't somehow mean the scales are balanced. It just means the world is complicated and there's even more to consider now.",4,"While disappointing, I cannot say your view is unique here on reddit or anywhere else in the country, so I'm glad you're here on CMV.

I'm really struggling with this one, CMV. This is my first post here. Reading through threads concerning this issue here on Reddit has made me wonder if I'm just a heartless jackass or not since it appears most of Reddit goes against the grain with me on this issue here. 

I don't feel like it's wrong to drug test welfare recipients. I agree somewhat with the view that if I am required to pass a drug test to even have a shot at a job, a welfare recipient should have to do the same to receive assistance which they're not required to work for. I've heard that a 30 day rehabilitation option is offered in some states for people who test positive, and benefits are cut off for those who refuse that option. I don't agree with punishing someone for addiction and not offering help, but if the drug testing states implemented this policy, I don't think I'd see any problems with it at all. 

I feel this way because I've been in a lot of situations where this has been a relevant issue. Cashiering for a small town grocery store growing up, knowing the people using food stamps at the counter, and also knowing that the majority if them are using drugs (small town) helped me form an opinion early on. I didn't think it was fair that at 16, my tax money was being used to help someone pay for food when they spent their money on drugs. If they wanted food, why not by it instead of drugs? Of course, now that I'm older I realize that not everything is so black and white, and that this goes deeper than my 16 year old opinion. 

I'm a home health nurse that works with pediatric patients in their homes. My patients are almost always in very poor, run down neighborhoods. All of these families are on food stamps and government assistance (my nursing contract is paid through their Medicaid) and literally, out of the last 10 families I've worked with, 4 of the parents used some kind of drug in front of me, and at least 3 more parents were very obviously using drugs. I'm not counting alcohol or tobacco use either, just what's actually being tested for. 

I have compassion and empathy for people, and I'm very left-leaning on most issues. I'm 100% for human rights, and I try to imagine myself in other's shoes before forming an opinion, but this is something that I just don't see a problem with, especially if rehabilitation is an offered option. I've also struggled with my own habits and addictions to alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana. I realize not all people are the same, but any time I've needed a job badly enough, I've been able to kick the weed and nicotine long enough to pass a pre employment screening. I feel like that's my responsibility, and that plays into why I've formed the opinion that I have.

So help me out, CMV. Change my view.

Edit: I should also probably note that I understand the low statistics on how many people actually do end up popping positive in these tests, and I realize that it's costing a lot of tax money to do so. I don't think it's a waste of tax payer money if these people are being offered an option to be rehabilitated. ","Most drug users aren't addicts.  Most addicts are still good parents.

There is a pretty big intersection in the ""bad-parent/drug-addict"" venn diagram, but one still doesn't imply the other.

It sounds like you're more upset that these people are wasting taxpayer money.


If I blow my entire cheque on DVDs, shoes or drugs - the effect is the same.

What, really, is the difference?  ",The main reason I am against drug testing welfare recipients is because to me it violates the 4th ammendment which protects people from unreasonable search and seizure. I fall on the side that because you need welfare is not a good enough reason to be subject to a search of drug use through a drug test. It is a tough moral issue either way though. You also need to remember that it isn't difficult to cheat on a drug test and that many of these people aren't actually using drugs. There will always be a percentage that takes advantage of welfare but it is usually small. By drug testing it does end up costing the taxpayer more and doesn't really resolve the issue of getting these people off drugs and into a lifestyle they can be successful in. All it really seems to do is make it harder to pull themselves back up.,5,The main reason I am against drug testing welfare recipients is because to me it violates the 4th ammendment which protects people from unreasonable search and seizure.

"I believe that we are at the point where we potentially *could* avoid bringing about catastrophic climate change, but to do that we would need to drop absolutely everything, to change our lifestyles in the most dramatic of ways, and we would need to unify and mobilize everybody to address this issue (at the expense of almost everything else).

And I believe that it's too late for us to do this because it would take changes so dramatic that the people who are most invested in society as it is today (the rich and powerful) would resist it will everything they have. A lack of serious committments and changes is indicative of this.


I believe that we are on the brink of a number of tipping points, if we haven't already passed them:

Along with that is the albedo flip where as the ice melts and pools of water accumulate on the top of ice sheets, they become a sort of heatsink, absorbing solar energy and causing nearby ice to melt, creating further pools of water. The melting of frozen methane escaping into the atmosphere is a similar effect which will cause another feedback loop as methane is a much more effective greenhouse gas, in orders of magnitude (is it 40x?) above carbon dioxide.


* Oceanic acdification threatening to grind not only oxygen production to a virtual standstill but also threatening to destroy the very foundation of oceanic life by removing the ability for the cornerstone of the oceanic foodchain, phytoplankton, to form. If this happens, then the natural cycle of nutrients from the oceans to the waterways back to the land will come to a grinding halt, meaning that the once rich and fertile liminal lands along coastlines will become barren and waterways will end up eutrophying and becoming undrinkable.


* The destruction of peat bogs and/or the reduction of the capacity of peat bogs to keep the carbon they contain sequestered.


* Runaway forest fires causing feedback loops as the hotter and drier the world gets, the more likely severe forest fires will be which will in turn increase the carbon in the atmosphere.


* The potential for rainforest ecosystems to collapse thereby increasìng atmospheric carbon while ceasing to function as carbon sinks.


* Desertification rapidly increasing due to increased temperatures and reduced/erratic rainfall thereby reducing plant life and the ability for ecosystems to absorb carbon dioxide.


* The potential for climate change to affect the ability of cloud formation and water vapor to reflect sunlight.


But the biggest factor in all of this, and the one tipping point which we have already passed is this one &amp;mdash; the social tipping point. (Granted this is hypothetical and I admit that it's difficult to argue against speculation and prognostication.) 

What I see as the social tipping point is the part where people stop caring because they feel entirely powerless to affect any change, where governments choose not to act for leverage (political/financial etc.), where governments and corporations choose not to act in order to preserve/increase profits, where the food supply gets put under more pressure due changes in climate (extremes, predictability, rainfall etc.) and so people will be less interested in eating locally or sustainably and more interested in just trying to get enough food, where electricity usage will skyrocket as people try to maintain a comfortable temperature indoors while it's either baking or freezing outside, where we will be faced with increasingly severe humanitarian crises (water shortages, coastal flooding, islands being submerged, famines etc.), where wars over resources will only increase, and the sum of these social feedback loops will cripple our ability to focus on ways to address runaway climate change because we will be dealing with other more urgent issues that cannot be ignored.

The reason that I believe we have passed this so-called social tipping point is because collectively we have not only failed to halt carbon emissions, but instead we have only been increasing them. If there were hope for us to achieve serious change in order to avert catastrophic climate change, it would be indicated by the countries of the world rallying to make carbon emissions simply plateau. But we can't even do that. So I believe that it's too late for the world to not only stop the increase of carbon emissions, but that it's too late to be able to bring about the dramatic changes in lifestyles/living standards etc. required to avoid either increasing carbon emissions (which is a catastrophe) or simply halting carbon emissions where they are right now (which is a catastrophe).


And I think that as we have surpassed this social tipping point, it will cause feedback loops in society as well as in the environment which will push us increasingly faster down a path of catastrophic climate change.


N.B.: I'm not saying that humans are fundamentally incapable of changing the way they live their lives and their environmental impact. I'm not saying that life will be extinguished altogether, in fact I'm not even saying that humans as a species won't survive, but I'm saying that our societies and our progress almost certainly will not survive. I'm not saying that if we all pulled together and put *everything* we had into averting catastrophic climate change we couldn't stop it. I'm not saying that a revolution that sweeps the globe and changes the fundamental nature of the way society organizes itself around production, consumption, and our relation to the environment couldn't stop this. And I'm not saying that there won't be the potential for some miracle techno-fix that will save everything in the eleventh hour. I'm saying that for us to have anything more than the most infinitesimally small chance that we might be able to save ourselves from climate change somehow that we would need to have already made big strides on this front, and the way that the world is geared means that we are effectively stuck barrelling towards catastrophic climate change in an ever-accelerating manner and that this is demonstrated by us not being able to put the brakes on now, and that's without even trying to put it into reverse (to overstretch the metaphor).

Please, please change my view.

[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3gb6h1/cmv_i_believe_that_it_is_too_late_for_humans_to/ctwso7w) made me realize that big changes could be brought about through a number of ways without the climate getting so bad that we'd need to be neck deep in seawater.


I'm still skeptical that we'll be able to pull it off, and I still think that there are a ton of hazards that our current economic system presents us with which we will need to address, but if the circumstances were right (e.g. strong carbon taxes, ratifying the Kyoto treaty, a functional emissions trading market etc.) we really *could* reduce carbon emissions as well as atmospheric carbon in a practical and realistic way that would avert catastrophic climate change.

In another comment there's a link to a recent /r/science AMA on climate change which addressed how I was buying into alarmism when the reality doesn't actually seem quite so dire when you look at the evidence. At least not yet anyway.

 Between those two comments in particular, my view has been changed.","I don't think catastrophic climate change is for certain. Let me spin you a pollyanna story. I'm not saying it will happen, but it might ....  

The main environmental problem of our time is the use of fossil fuels (coal, petroleum and natural gas) for *energy*. About half of our energy use is via electricity, coal (the worse offender in terms of global warming) is mainly used for electricity generation. Petroleum is used mainly for transportation. [Chart](https://www.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/field/image/28228_flowcharthighres.png) 

First, let's assume the cost of wind and solar energy keeps on dropping at [10 to 15% per year](http://cleantechnica.com/2014/04/16/solars-dramatic-cost-fall-may-herald-energy-price-deflation/). On the profit principle alone, companies stop building new fossil fuel electricity generation plants; within the next ten years, they start decommissioning old fossil fuel power plants because it's cheaper to produce using wind and solar. By 2050, almost all the fossil fuel power plants are gone, and no one burns coal (the dirtiest fuel) anymore.  

Second, suppose the [drop in production costs for lithium-ion batteries accelerates](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/energy_resources_materials/battery_technology_charges_ahead). Over the next 5 years, costs drop by more than half. This makes it cheaper to build a electric car than a petrol-fueled car. Manufacturers and consumers shift over to electric cars en masse, since powering an electric car is so much cheaper than buying petrol for a normal car. The cheaper rechargeable batteries also solve the problem of how to smooth-out the variability of power generation from a wind-and-solar-based grid. Almost everyone has something like a [Tesla Powerwall](http://rt.com/business/256521-tesla-battery-big-business/) hanging in their garage, and hooked up to their mains.

Third, and this is the most iffy, sometime in the next 10 years, all major countries ratify the [Kyoto accord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol) and start taking it seriously. They increase taxes on fossil fuels and impose punitive duties on imports from countries that do not abide by the accord. The cost of using coal and petroleum rise. Because of taxes, coal becomes too expensive to use compared to cheaper alternatives, and coal mines shut down. Petroleum use gradually declines, as companies and consumers find cheaper alternatives. 

By 2050, electricity production no longer uses fossil fuels, and electric cars have largely taken over the roads. Petroleum is mainly used for aviation and shipping. However, increasing taxation and continued progress on biofuels gradually wean these industries from petroleum, and [airlines and ships move over to using biofuels](https://www.iata.org/pressroom/facts_figures/fact_sheets/pages/alt-fuels.aspx). The US military enthusiatically embraces biofuels, as the supply is less vulnerable to disruption. 

By 2060, the world has largely stopped using fosil fuels. Air pollution is a thing of the past, and urban emphysema and lung cancer rates drop. World population [peaks at 8 billion in 2050, and stabilizes.](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130404072923.htm) Increased agricultural productivity, higher GDP, and a stabilizing world population, allows countries to put environmental issues on the fron burner. Climate change increases rainfall over sub-saharan Africa, leading to the greening of the Sahara. In regions where climate change reduced rainfall, [new desalination technologies mitigate the worst effects.](http://e360.yale.edu/feature/new_desalination_technologies_spur_growth_in_recycling_water/2770/) Economic development moves people to urban areas, forests regrow, and mankind becomes carbon-negative for the first time since the industrial revolution. 
","I do share some of your fears, but you also need to trust in advances in science and engineering to solve many of the problems. Renewable energy is increasingly competitive and a lot of money and research is going into making it the default option. As fossil fuels become more scarce they will become more expensive, which will further tip the equation in favour of renewables. I also believe that increasingly, advances in science that reverse some of the effects of climate change are not beyond our reach.

I also believe that when whole societies start to feel the financial downsides of climate change they will start to act. It's somewhat depressing that people in comfortable Westernised societies aren't moved by melting ice-caps or displaced groups of poor people on the far side of the world, but are when home insurance premiums go up every year because of regular flooding of coastal or low-lying areas. Either way, as I believe that as people start to witness tangible impacts, funding for scientific research will increase, people will accept more legislation to e.g. impose heavy taxes on carbon-heavy things, and so on. 

The bit I can't offer you much comfort over is the effect on marine life - yes, it may be that we are doing untold damage there, and coupled with over-fishing it paints a bleak picture. We are already living through one of the world's great extinctions, which again is largely down to mankind's effect on the planet.

My great hope is that as the people of the world get to know each other better they will work together better. The internet, primarily, is changing the world for the better - people around the world are connected in ways they never were, and a lot of the traditional divisions between socieities - religions, nationality, language etc - are breaking down, meaning that people are able to come together to make things happen in new ways. I would hope that before too long the whole world can come together to plan how to run this planet properly - we are now powerful enough to destroy ourselves and everything else on this planet if we don't learn some kind of husbandry on a planetary level, so sooner or later we'll have to start working together to shape the planet we want, including how we re-build animal and plant life to a level that benefits mankind.

And one final thought to cheer you up: my parents' generation were genuinely terrified of nuclear war, terrified that they would get a 4-minute warning to hide under their desks before they were turned into a ball of fire. So firstly, be grateful that climate change being our biggest threat at least doesn't mean you're going to be turned into a ball of fire in your own home, but also see recent nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation treaties as evidence that mankind, however much we may disagree, is eventually able to recognise such threats and work together to step back from the brink.",6,"I do share some of your fears, but you also need to trust in advances in science and engineering to solve many of the problems.

Other languages such as Spanish the pronunciation of a word is pretty straight forward.  I understand that the conjugation is the only tough part and the whole gender thing might be confusing at first (not that crazy if it ends on an a it's female, except agua which can be both, the only tough part is if it end on an e). Also English is not even the most spoken language in the world where Mandarin is first followed by Spanish. English is rising only because it's commonly being taught as a second language, if you change the language it will also rise.

Also the whole small scale system that English has does not even make sense like why a billion is a thousand of a million where in long scale it's a million of a million.

I know this seems biased like I am arguing that Spanish should be the international language and it's my native language, but it makes more sense if it were. I didn't defend Mandarin because I've always had the impression of it being one of the hardest language to master. If it's otherwise I apologize and anyone who speaks other languages are welcome to support why your language should be the international language.

"I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it (""It's the oldest profession""; ""we should have full rights to our bodies"") don't hold up too well, neither do a lot of the arguments against it. **(As a side note, I'll be referring to women but all these arguments could reliably be applied to male prostitutes for the most part)**

One of the most oft-touted arguments that I seem to see is that ""Women will be forced into prostitution because they have no other options"".

I fail to see this as a legitimate concern. Not because I don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because I don't see how this is a bad thing. If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental *and* physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?

If I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because ""Desperate people might feel obligated to work them"", would that make sense? I don't think so. A McJob is a McJob, and a McBlowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. One could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. The only argument I could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which I concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, I'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.

I think a regulated, safe, and well-operated system of brothels (and only brothels, to ensure there are no dangers to streetwalkers/regulations can be easily enforced) would reduce the amount of dangers as well as offer additional opportunities. To clarify, this system would involve:

&gt;Similar regulations to the porn industry (mandatory screening for all workers, 100% condom use by 'johns', provided and required birth control, contracts either requiring abortion/absolving the secondary party of any/all liability and responsibility, physically and financially, in the unlikely event (but by law of large numbers unpreventable) double failure of condoms and birth control.

&gt;Protection, both on and immediately off of brothel grounds, by well-maintained security forces.

&gt;New legislation that ensures any fraud or intentional failure to pay (in the event some brothel didn't take money up front) constitutes rape.

&gt;Harsh crackdowns and harsher penalties for pimping, street walkers, and other institutions (""Massage parlors""). Death penalties/life sentences (where it isn't already) for human trafficking and sexual slavery, all the way down the ladder, and rehabilitation for victims of this.

(Actually, that last one would be good with or without legalized, but whatever).

**What I'd like to see to Change My View (in addition to any logical moral/emotional arguments):**

-Studies on legalization that prove it's not safe/causes societal repercussions more severe than the benefits.

-Studies on lack of effects (or worsening) of street prostitutes/pimp culture.

-Anything else relevant to disprove anything I've said here.

**What I would not like to see:**

-Outright moral arguments (""Selling your body is wrong"", anonymous/casual sex is a sin)

-Any arguments I listed above without additions (""Women will be forced into sex slavery"")

-Religious arguments

Thanks for your time :3

First of all, it's a false equivalency to say that people have a choice between either A) prostitution or B) starvation.   In most western countries, prositition is practically never the *only* option women with limited marketably skills/education have to make money, it just happens to be the most lucrative.  Waiting tables, cashiering, working retail, coupled with a relatively strong social safety net (like foodstamps, medicaid, rental credit/section 8 housing), is how the vast majority of the working poor survive.

It isn't just psychological and physical damage, there's some serious damage to both the immediate incentives and long term prosperity of people, particularly women, that go into prostitution, which are quite destructive.  Lets ignore the psychological damage/addiction cycles synonimous with prostitution and focus instead simple career growth, total earning potential, and the cycle of poverty.  A prostitute's peak earning potential is when they are the youngest and freshest (probably), and gradually dimishes from there.  Lets say a 20 year old can make 200-300 a night, 5 nights a week, that works out to about 50k-70k per year.  Very good income for someone of that age, certainly tough to walk away from considering the expected income of 20-30k, but nothing you can retire off of, and that's their peak income, and it will only go down from there. After 10 years, they're 30, maybe they're still pretty hot, but they can only get 150 a night.  so that means that after 10 years experience, the 45K.  5 years later, they're probably starting to show their age, lets say it drops down to 150.  39k.  Once they hit 40 they're most likely on their way down, if they stay in tip top shape, they could probably still get 100 a night. (even that's kind of generous).  

At what point does the person decide that the money isn't worth it anymore?  Is that point before or after when they feel like they're young enough where they can start their career in something else?  Does someone who go into prostitution hope to work in the same industry until retirement age?  

While it's true that low wage work isn't great, it can lead to opportunities of advancement, promotions and pay raises.  There are virtually zero of these in prostitution.

On the flip side, legal prostitution means higher demand from consumers, leading more people to pay for it, and increasing hte number of people going into as a profession.   While the level of damage each individual would decrease, the number of total damage would increase.

The types of people that choose this type of work would be lower class people with little career perspectives that would make some money for a while, but over the long term, most would be screwing themselves over financially and careerwise in the long term.","Your argument assumes that a person may be faced with a choice between sex work and slow starvation. This isn't true in most first world nations. The social safety net does a pretty good job keeping mouths fed. 

There are exceptions to this of course, but most of them are solvable (husband drinks all the money away) or involve other illegal activity (drug addictions).

So, given that the social safety nets will keep people from starving, what's the difference between legal sex work and illegal sex work? If sex work is legalized, poor people will have to try sex work before welfare becomes available to them. **Poor people will be *expected* to try sex work before they are given relief.**  

""Can't get a normal job? Have you tried prostitution? No? Well, try that, and *then* the government will help you out.""

So, who cares? Well, you personally may not think that prostitution is immoral, but *billions* of other people do think that. Legalizing prostitution will mean saying to all those Catholic single mothers ""no, you can't have welfare support unless you're willing to sell your body."" Does that sound acceptable to you?",8,"Your argument assumes that a person may be faced with a choice between sex work and slow starvation. This isn't true in most first world nations. The social safety net does a pretty good job keeping mouths fed. 

There are exceptions to this of course, but most of them are solvable (husband drinks all the money away) or involve other illegal activity (drug addictions).

So, given that the social safety nets will keep people from starving, what's the difference between legal sex work and illegal sex work? If sex work is legalized, poor people will have to try sex work before welfare becomes available to them. **Poor people will be *expected* to try sex work before they are given relief.**  

""Can't get a normal job? Have you tried prostitution? No? Well, try that, and *then* the government will help you out.""

Does that sound acceptable to you?","&gt; If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental and physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?

First of all, it's a false equivalency to say that people have a choice between either A) prostitution or B) starvation.   In most western countries, prositition is practically never the *only* option women with limited marketably skills/education have to make money, it just happens to be the most lucrative.  Waiting tables, cashiering, working retail, coupled with a relatively strong social safety net (like foodstamps, medicaid, rental credit/section 8 housing), is how the vast majority of the working poor survive.

It isn't just psychological and physical damage, there's some serious damage to both the immediate incentives and long term prosperity of people, particularly women, that go into prostitution, which are quite destructive.  Lets ignore the psychological damage/addiction cycles synonimous with prostitution and focus instead simple career growth, total earning potential, and the cycle of poverty.  A prostitute's peak earning potential is when they are the youngest and freshest (probably), and gradually dimishes from there.  Lets say a 20 year old can make 200-300 a night, 5 nights a week, that works out to about 50k-70k per year.  Very good income for someone of that age, certainly tough to walk away from considering the expected income of 20-30k, but nothing you can retire off of, and that's their peak income, and it will only go down from there. After 10 years, they're 30, maybe they're still pretty hot, but they can only get 150 a night.  so that means that after 10 years experience, the 45K.  5 years later, they're probably starting to show their age, lets say it drops down to 150.  39k.  Once they hit 40 they're most likely on their way down, if they stay in tip top shape, they could probably still get 100 a night. (even that's kind of generous).  

At what point does the person decide that the money isn't worth it anymore?  Is that point before or after when they feel like they're young enough where they can start their career in something else?  Does someone who go into prostitution hope to work in the same industry until retirement age?  

While it's true that low wage work isn't great, it can lead to opportunities of advancement, promotions and pay raises.  There are virtually zero of these in prostitution.

On the flip side, legal prostitution means higher demand from consumers, leading more people to pay for it, and increasing hte number of people going into as a profession.   While the level of damage each individual would decrease, the number of total damage would increase.

The types of people that choose this type of work would be lower class people with little career perspectives that would make some money for a while, but over the long term, most would be screwing themselves over financially and careerwise in the long term.",r2,0.8,0.5,0.7,0.6,0.5,0.0,0.7,0.4,0.8,0.0,0.3,0.8,0.7,0.6,0.0,0.8,0.3,0.7,0.0,0.4,r2,,
"I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into taking her's husband's last name, and gay spouses also have a conundrum of their own. 

However, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. One small example is if you work in an industry where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind (like I do). It's helpful to know in advance who is related to who by just looking at a piece of paper.

BUT, if the wife and the husband choose not to share a last name, please God settle on one name for your kid. Just flip a coin for which last name your kid takes if that's what you need to do. Don't make everyone around him have to deal with saying and writing out Reginald Henry Lieberman-Montgomery. 

A metaphor I would make for this would be gender pronouns. You have the right to tell me whether you identify as a man or a woman, but I swear to God if you insist that everyone around you refer to you strictly with the gender neutral pronouns Ni, Nem and Nir, I will be having none of it. 

As a counterpoint, I will say that I can't ever imagine myself taking my wife's last name. And if she chose not to take mine, I think I would feel a little disappointed. Further, I can't imagine feeling comfortable with my kid not taking my last name. So I already recognize a bit of the hypocrisy. In that way, I see that I am posing a problem without an apparent solution. On top of your rebuttals, I would also be curious to hear alternative ideas/social structures that could work to level the playing field, AND prevent me from having to say a mouthful. 

**EDIT:**

Apologies for the day long delay-- car emergency took all night and all morning.

Thanks for all your responses! Here are some of my views you've changed. 

Spain &gt; 'Murica. There's a clear system in place in Spanish countries that actually speaks to my ""one family name"" point. People consistently take the fathers, then mother's surname. Then the kid's kids will do the same. Gives you family history and also something to put on your mailbox. 

What I personally like about this is that it's uniform. If two last names were adopted country-wide in America, I would have much less of a problem with it. 

I also want to clarify: My problem with the ""mouthful"" of hyphenated last names does not mean that I would also suggest gentrifying the Krzyzewskis and the Chevaprevadumrongs of the world. To shorten your family name is to bastardize it. No ill feelings to those with shortened last names of course-- my last name was actually gentrified two generations ago. 

Finally, here is a post that very well summarizes my American sentiments: 

&gt; While this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to “People who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. People who name their kids something I dislike or don’t understand are selfish and stupid.” You have not said this, but I think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated.

&gt; You want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. If a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate.

My American sensibilities that shorter is better are deeply ingrained and will probably be there 'til I die. That said, at least I can recognize them so that I know to keep them in check. 

While I will continue to make fun of people who have two last names, it will be with the same conviction that I make fun of everyone else. No hostility here.

Thanks guys!","I think you already know you are rationally incorrect, but you are trying to justify an instinctive preference for the naming system that   ""feels"" right in your gut. The single-last-name-of-father system likely feels most correct to you because it (a) is most familiar and (b) gives you the most benefits while asking the fewest concessions. First, you know that you have an ingrained and biased preference about names: you prefer your wife and children take your name, but would feel uncomfortable or disappointed by the opposite. This is not a topic on which you are neutral and simply trying to find the easiest universal system.

As a measure of clarity – who is related to whom – hyphenating provides *more* information. The single-last-name system obscures familial relationships in comparison.

As a measure of legal identity – how many people share your name – hyphenating makes each name more distinct. 

I too work in an industry where I deal with thousands of names and families. The single last name system does not allow me to know “who is related to who” at anything better than an educated guess. I know dozens of families who share last names but no close relation. I know dozens of blended families. I know dozens of guardians who don’t share names with children, and committed couples who are not married. I also know siblings who get mistaken for spouses, and spouses who have been mistaken for siblings. Helping strangers make assumptions based on a single last name seems like the weakest possible defense. 

As a matter of personal identity – the right of a couple to determine family identity and choose names that are appropriate, representative, and meaningful – having a range of possibilities means couples can make a decision about how they understand their family construction. Group labeling and identity are incredibly strong sociological forces. 

As a measure of ease – spelling, length – that consideration does not exist in any other naming context, and it becomes absurd to try to impose the ease standard universally. If your wife had a much shorter last name than you, would it be inconsiderate to give your own name to your children? Is it unnecessarily complicated to give children a first name with more than one syllable? Is it unacceptable to name your child after your French mother if the name may be difficult for American businesses? 

Maybe more to he point, though, the difference in ease between the most complex and most simple names I have *ever* written has been minor - a dozen letters, a double-check on spelling, a confirmation. Literally a difference of a few seconds.

I do see nods to individual choice in your post, but only if you never have to interact with a world where people choose differently than you. 

Women should not have to take their husband’s name, but you only want to marry a woman who will. Men should have the option to take their wife’s name, but you'll never consider it. Children can have either parent's name, as long as yours have *only* their father's. Gay couples need ways to build family identity, but only if you don't have to see a hyphenated name.

Also, as a side-note, it is a pretty well-documented phenomenon that people are less likely to change a position after taking a public stance. You begin by saying you have “had a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names.” If you have expressed “joking” superiority or derision towards people who do not like the same names you like, then you may feel compelled to justify that you were just smarter all along, rather than arbitrarily judgmental or dickish.

"The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship, and that these guys are frustrated/critical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns. Single guys suffering deserve as much respect and empathy as women who may face different challenges. Also, these guys are often being vulnerable to their crushes and trying to start a romantic relationship.

"I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still hold its unacceptable to break the law the way BLM did. 

My friend argued back that since both of us are white, we can never understand the situation and the anger these representatives of BLM feel. Therefore, she argued, we cannot criticize their actions since we cannot and can never understand their perspective.

My friend showed me [this article](http://time.com/3605606/ferguson-in-defense-of-rioting/) in defense of her argument. I'll quote from the conclusion,

&gt;Instead of tearing down other human beings who are acting upon decades of pent-up anger at a system decidedly against them, a system that has told them they are less than human for years, we ought to be reaching out to help them regain the humanity they lost, not when a few set fire to the buildings in Ferguson, but when they were born the wrong color in the post-racial America.

In response to the article, I essentially argued that while I do feel for minorities in the U.S, violence is neither a morally sound or pragmatic way to go about change. I also felt that the argument presented (we are not minorities, therefore we will never be able to understand, therefore we cannot criticize) is fundamentally unsound.

I'd love to hear some support for her viewpoint, because I am an open-minded person and I care about racial equality America

"It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified:

* The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for, either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild. If we're using the usual justification of animal rights - they can feel pain/have a life - then letting them lead a safe and happy life in captivity seems to be more moral than the dangers of the wild.

* This is a less quantifiable good, but zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies.

While I guess the best way to C my V would be to provide overwhelming evidence that zoos provide lower quality of life for the animals than life in the wild and that there are more effective means of conserving/promoting endanger species, I'm mostly interested in values/premises I haven't considered. 

Change my view! :)

  - endangered animals can be cared for : It's true but it's only a very small portions of endangered animals that the public find cute or know about that will be protected this way. The reasons why some animals are protected in the wild or in a zoo are wildly irrational.

  - Most of these animals are 'exotic' and you concern has very little chance of changing things in these animals former countries. Also there are many other ways to attract attention to these animals than enslave them and put them in a cage. We actually did that at the World Expo in Brussels with Congolese tribesmen. And I can conclusively confirm that it wasn't really conductive to intercultural understanding and enlightenment. It was another freak show, and the exploitation of living beings for financial purposes.

  - endangered animals can be cared for : It's true but it's only a very small portions of endangered animals that the public find cute or know about that will be protected this way. The reasons why some animals are protected in the wild or in a zoo are wildly irrational.

  - Most of these animals are 'exotic' and you concern has very little chance of changing things in these animals former countries. Also there are many other ways to attract attention to these animals than enslave them and put them in a cage. We actually did that at the World Expo in Brussels with Congolese tribesmen. And I can conclusively confirm that it wasn't really conductive to intercultural understanding and enlightenment. It was another freak show, and the exploitation of living beings for financial purposes.

So yes, zoo can be ethical but it has never been their vocation. They are not actual non-profit organizations.",r1,0.9,0.5,0.6,0.4,0.7,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.7,0.5,0.6,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.9,0.5,0.5,r1,,
"First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate.  

Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I believe they should be free for several reasons:

- One's health is essentially a genetic lottery. You shouldn't be punished because you were unlucky enough to develop cancer or be born with a blood disease

- Health can be a direct result of economic conditions and people should not be punished because of the quality and quantity of food their parent(s) provide.

- Education is essentially an economic lottery. If you don't have enough money to pay for college, good luck. Many people are only able to take out student loans because of a cosigner (or their parents outright pay it). Parent's don't have the credit? Your shit out of luck.

- Education is the foundation for the future of society. Forget job opportunities for now, higher education provides valuable skills that cannot be learned anywhere else. By not providing equal opportunities, we are decreasing the intelligence of the population.

- By educating the population, especially the poor, we will decrease crime as well. As of now, many poor kids know they'll never go to college even before they reach high school. By giving equal opportunity, kids will have incentive to stay in school and stay out of trouble. At least they *can* go to college.

- By not providing free education and health care, we are putting our population into a deeper hole of debt, crime and stupidity. A smart and healthy population can contribute to society much more than the status quo (in America). 

Essentially, education and health are lotteries. Some get lucky while most don't. People should not be punished because of this. Investing money into an infrastructure that provides free education and health care is the basis for an advanced society.

I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for drug distribution they can choose to die. This would decrease prison population and relief funding to the prison system. Less people = less taxpayers have to spend. The prisoner would get to choose if they want to die, but the state would perform the execution. This would only apply to people 18 years or older.

Prisoners sometimes have to endure very horrible things while in prison. Rape, sexual assault and violence affect many prisoners that are serving time for theft, drugs, etc. This would also apply to criminals who are terminally ill and suffer everyday from the side effects.
People are given life sentences without parole for non violent offenses sometimes.

I believe it is right to give these criminals an option to end their life's so they don't have to suffer in prison if they don't want to.

*I'll give you a partial ∆ because I do think that New Friends works as a combination option, but I think my CMV is more focused on the idea of someone who's either exclusively listed as For Friends, or their profile makes it out that they are primarily (nearly exclusively) for friends. I think in terms of actually being useful to users, it would be nice to have some kind of flagging system for this. My main gripe is that all these sites just show you faces and user names, and you don't really know that these people aren't interested until you've already been drawn in.*

*This is based on my experience over about 4-6 months of casually using Tinder and OkC, if that helps you form any counter arguments or gives any perspective. Also, this isnt about poly relationships looking for another partner, the scope of my view doesn't even approach that.*

Something I've noticed with slightly surprising frequency on dating sites are profiles that have one of the following kinds of statements- ""Looking for friends, no commitments."", ""My husband/boyfriend knows I have this to make friends, and I'm not going to cheat so don't bother"", ""I just moved here and thought this would be a good way to make some friends"", ""I don't take this seriously, I'm just here for the laughs, really not looking for a relationship"" ... etc...

Personally, I feel these kinds of profiles don't belong on dating sites, and only serve to come off as disingenuous or disappointing. Most dating sites just give you a series of profile pictures and names, and you choose which ones you find attractive to open up and read. The image draws you in, and then the ""Just for friends"" lets you down. To me, this is like someone attending a speed dating night at a singles bar, someone finds them very attractive and wants to see about striking up a relationship, and then they say ""Oh I only came here to maybe find some friends and enjoy people trying too hard"". If you're really looking for friends, there are places designed for platonic relationships- in the context of online communities there's places like subreddits for local towns, there's meetup.com, there's plenty of public Facebook groups for all kinds of interests, etc... 

Going to a place specifically marketed to and called a dating app is just disingenuous. I wouldn't go to Ashley Madison if I just wanted to get a platonic shoe shopping buddy.

"So, one thing that I have to preface this with is that I see both(/all) sexes as equal, outside of a few natural sexual dimorphisms (Genitalia, ability to have children, testosterone causing some appearance traits, some tendency for risk taking). So, there are some basic genetic differences, but I believe that in general, a person's personality, intelligence, interests, (non-athletic) talents, and other traits are characteristic of upbringing, their environment, and social influences, with genetics as a whole playing a fairly small role outside of a few relatively uncommon instances like Down's Syndrome. 

Then, my view is that there is no real difference between feeling like your gender is male and feeling female. To me, it seems like the distinguishing factors between considering oneself male and female seem to hinge on social attitudes of what is feminine and what isn't feminine. I'm aware that there are some who describe themselves as transsexual without taking on the socially prescribed traits of the other gender, but in cases like that, again, I still don't understand, because fundamentally, there doesn't seem to be a necessary mental difference between men and women.

I'd prefer to make as few anecdotal arguments as possible, since I would prefer this doesn't turn into a battle of anecdotes, but whenever I see transsexuality discussed, it seems one focus is on the distinction between gender and sex. Personally though, when I say I am male, what I mean is that I am not intersex, and have male genitalia and have the corresponding risks of various diseases and injuries. I don't feel somehow male and I don't feel somehow female. I am perfectly comfortable as I am, but if I woke up tomorrow with female genitalia, I would have no problem referring to myself as female (I'd prefer we leave sexuality out of this discussion, since gender and orientation are generally treated separately).

Finally, I know there are some experiments where people who identify as homosexual/transsexual will tend to exhibit some other, non-obviously gender-related traits, that tend to match more closely to the other gender, but I feel like these results come largely again from the social byproducts or associations of gender/orientation (And I think the fact that this is in gender and orientation, not just transsexuality, reinforces it). I am aware of gender identity disorder and gender dysphoria, and again, I feel that it comes out of a variety of mental and social influences, or from an incongruity of one's sex to the social expectations of their gender but I don't feel like this is really demonstrative of a natural mental gender, but again symptomatic of the social characteristics of gender. 

On my view briefly. It's something I've thought about for a very long time and it's not something I can really openly discuss. Maybe show me that there is innate mental gender that demonstrably doesn't act as a societal function. I'm not sure, but hopefully I've given enough information that my view is quite clear and it's also clear that I'd be open to having it changed. Really, I'd prefer it changed and I feel like a big part of it is just my not understanding something somewhere. I'll also mention that I'm not in any way against transsexuals, and I feel like people are free to identify as they'd like as long as it doesn't hurt anyone and I'll interact with them without judging them because of it.

"I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, once you've had the kids it's selfless because of how much you have to give up for them. But the initial desire to birth them in the first place is selfish. I want my own children because I want to carry on my own genes. I want to have a little human that resembles me.  As a woman, I want to experience the feeling of a baby inside of me. These reasons are the main reasons why people choose to birth their own kids. 
Here's a few reasons why I find it selfish.

1. There are plenty of children out there without parents. Over 150 million orphans, not to mention foster children. Then here are people who are trying to birth their own when there are so many helpless children without a loving home.

2. There are over 800 million people starving in the world. People are dying from hunger and you're trying to bring another mouth that needs feeding into the world.

3. This reason may be a little unexpected but it's something I'm personally afraid of and so I feel it's a valid reason. I'm agnostic. You can believe whatever you want about the afterlife but that doesn't mean you actually know what will happen to us after we die. Whether we go to a heaven, a hell, are reincarnated, cease to exist or whatever else people can come up with. You just can't  know for sure and anyone who says differently is lying to themselves. Now that being said, say hell is a reality. I hope it isn't but you never know. What if you birthed these children out of your selfish desire and they did just whatever it took to have themselves sent to hell forever. Even if you did pick the ""right"" religion doesn't mean that your child is going to believe it. 


Honestly, I would love for someone to change my mind. My ex and I broke up over this because I want to adopt children and he wants biological children. I just can't morally justify purposely bringing children in the world.

Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","Economically and socially, not having children when you have the means to raise them is a far more selfish act.

First, let's focus the discussion on the US, since that is where I assume you live.  After all, most of those 150 million orphans cannot be easily or legally adopted into the US, and those 800 million starving people is not because we lack food (we have a major surplus), it is about logistics and failed political states.

Anyways, in the US, there were only 101,666 children legally up for adoption in 2012, and of them 52,039 children were adopted. [Source] (http://www.ccainstitute.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=43) 

That contrasts the ~3.9 million babies born each year. [Source](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm)

In other words, the majority children in the US who can be adopted *are* adopted, and even if all of them were, it would not cover even 2.5% of the births that happen.

It is also important to note that even with all those births, the US doesn't meet its replacement rate.  That means that our population would be declining if not for massive amount of immigrants we take in.

Now, why is this important?  Because our economic and especially our social systems depend on new productive workers to enter the workforce as old ones retire.  Without them, the economy would collapse, social programs would go bankrupt, and we would basically experience a long depression until our population rates stabilized or increased.

Now why is it selfish?

Well, while society bares *some* of the cost of creating these new workers through free public education, the vast majority of the money and time used to produce them comes from the parents of the child.  

In other words, the parents are sacrificing their own resources to produce something that all of society needs.  This is the opposite of selfish.

Alternatively, a person who doesn't have children and retires is instead reaping the advantages of having those new workers work in factories and pay taxes for things like social security benefits and firefighters without having to contribute to making new workers themselves.  From a societal perspective, that is much more selfish.","The world has always revolved around people having children.  It is innate in our biological make up to want to have children and raise them.   If everyone felt like you did, we'd have an opposite problem. In fact, Japan does have that problem and the US could be not too far behind them some believe.   While true plenty of children could use a good home, that doesn't take away the biological desire to have your own children and the good that can come of having your own.

First, let's focus the discussion on the US, since that is where I assume you live.  After all, most of those 150 million orphans cannot be easily or legally adopted into the US, and those 800 million starving people is not because we lack food (we have a major surplus), it is about logistics and failed political states.

Anyways, in the US, there were only 101,666 children legally up for adoption in 2012, and of them 52,039 children were adopted. [Source] (http://www.ccainstitute.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=43) 

That contrasts the ~3.9 million babies born each year. [Source](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm)

In other words, the majority children in the US who can be adopted *are* adopted, and even if all of them were, it would not cover even 2.5% of the births that happen.

It is also important to note that even with all those births, the US doesn't meet its replacement rate.  That means that our population would be declining if not for massive amount of immigrants we take in.

"I say ""killer asteroid"" in the title for brevity, but I mean any celestial object (asteroid, comet, planetoid, etc) large enough to wipe out life on Earth.

I have three basic reasons:

1. We know there are no planet-destroyers in the Asteroid Belt, which means anything that'd take out Earth would need to come from the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud.  Both of these are very far away, and would give us lots of warning, even if the object were presently on its impact trajectory orbit.  More likely, we'd detect it multiple orbits in advance, and have decades or centuries before predicted impact.  But I think we'll at least have multiple years.

2. Nuclear weapons would be pretty effective at deflecting an object.  They are very energy dense, and [we can use a standoff detonation](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/report2007.html) to cause ablation on one side of the comet/asteroid and nudge it.  We only need a very slight nudge to push it off of an Earthbound trajectory when it is far away.

3. If an impact were imminent, humanity would throw all feasible resources into stopping it.  A lot of the things which make present space travel difficult would be overcome fast.  We would allow launches which have a high chance of spreading radioactive debris onto Earth for instance, or which have a high chance of loss of human life.  We might even send astronauts on a suicide mission.  Of course, money would be no object for this, and massive logistical resources would be poured into anything with a chance of saving us.

A lot of the things which make present space travel difficult would be overcome fast.

Right now we don't have a rocket capable of putting a large bomb on Earth escape trajectory. Throwing money at NASA won't get us an SLS instantly. Rockets take a long time to build and need lots of testing before actually flying.

I am not saying it is impossible or that we wouldn't be able to get a rocket ready to launch in time but as of now it is a real possibility.

It is also important to note that the longer we wait the larger payload we would need to divert the asteroid. Even if it is several years out, every month we wait would increase the size of the payload. Also, as the asteroid got closer it wouldn't be any easier to rendezvous with. Unless we were going for a high speed impact we would still need massive amounts of delta-v (enough to escape Earth's SOI and make the needed plane change maneuvers).

So I hope we could do it but if we had a 5 year warning right now we would be in a very precarious position. Remember it could take several years to rendezvous with the asteroid even with an SLS block 2 payload. If we put another couple year delay on that the size of asteroid we could deflect would be smaller than you may expect.

Of course all the numbers depend on the size of the asteroid and amount of warning we have but we could easily get into a situation right now where we could not deflect an asteroid in time.

"Oat blenders.  Mini spooners.  Coco roos.  Honey Scooters.  You know them.  You see them in the cereal section of any grocery store.  They are in giant bags in a metal bin right next to the boxed cereals.  Far too often, these bagged cereals are breezed past and not rightfully regarded as the most superior way to purchase cereal.

* Price - Cant beat it.  Per unit weight, they are far cheaper than their boxed counterparts.

* Freshness - Fresh to death.  The bags all come with a resealable spout, much like a ziploc bag.  Squeeze all the air out, reseal, and you are ready for the next day.  

* Taste - Admittedly, they are not superior in taste to boxed counterparts.  But they are indistinguishable.  

* Environmental - Bagged cereals use less than half the packaging of boxed cereals.  

* Quantity - Get a lot more, which prevents you from having to worry about breakfast for much longer. 

* Hilarity - I snicker to myself every day that I pour myself a bowl of apple zings. Never once chuckled at a box of applejax. 

Edit - Some good points about selection and variety.  Maybe I should have rephrased my title better to reflect that bagged cereals are better than their boxed counterparts.

* stack neatly (if the sizes match, which they are standardized)

* Most people wont judge them for it

* They have no compassion for the animal

I feel compassion for animals and so I dont contribute to their mass-abuse and slaughter, aside from the obivously immoral support of animal cruelty there's a bunch of reasons why vegetarianism is better for the earth, for your health etc, but until I gained that compassion it didnt matter to me.

People like to act like their decision to eat meat is some kind of well thought-out position that they're sure is logically and morally sound, but IMO its 100% backwards rationalisation. They already made the decision to eat meat as a child without thinking about it at all, and they want to keep doing it so they try to explain to themself why they do it instead of honestly thinking about whether or not they actually should.

Eating meat can never be more or as ethical as not eating meat, because you're taking life needlessly and contributing to/causing (no snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible) all kinds of abuse towards animals. But people just dont really give a shit.

What this selective outrage over Cecil tells me is that we, as a society, simply don't have any unified logic towards how we are supposed to treat animals and instead attach our moral views of animal treatment to whatever our culture finds fashionable. Walter James Palmer is potentially going to face criminal charges while Tyson and Perdue make an industry out of their treatment of animals. There is little difference. 

Edit: My opinion on this has been changed. Cecil's existence as a national treasure to Zimbabwe is enough to justify selective outrage. Moreover, Cecil's death specifically highlights issues inherent in illegal poaching.

With that said I find it kind of scary that there is a Clinton and a Bush in this election. The kings in Denmark used to be elected, some thousand years ago, but then it became normal to elect kings from the same familly. Then latter it was always the oldest son and then we endeed up with the system where the king was always the oldest son from the old king. The same is more or less true in many other countries. People seem to rather want to vote on people from families they know than random people.

To me it kind of seems like America is getting set in their political dynasties and that if this development continues, we might end up with a system where everyone in theory can try to be elected president, but in practise it will always be people from the same political dynasties that gets elected.

"I’m a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find silly/trivial. I’m currently dating a girl who is a VERY strong feminist. Over the weekend we were playing Mario Kart 64 and for as long as I can remember my go to character for Nintendo games has been Peach. There’s really no particular reason I do this other than I seem to do the best with Peach.

When I won the grand prix my girlfriend said “Ugh, I hate Peach, she’s such a weak and stereotypical female video game character.” To which I jokingly replied “Wow, that’s a SUPER sexist thing to say, and she’s obviously not that weak since I crushed you with her.” And her response to that was “Peach negatively reinforces the idea that women are weak and can only be saved by men in power like Mario.”

Then I made the mistake of saying “Well I don’t think that’s true.” We ended up getting into an argument over the portrayal of females in video games and how that perpetuates stereotypes in the real world. Her main argument was that most females in video games are portrayed as weak and need help from the male characters and this is detrimental to women in real life.

There were two issues I had with her argument, the first one being that there are a TON of badass female characters in video games who don’t need no man: Samus, Rosalina, Zelda/Sheik, Palutena, Bayonetta, Lara Croft, Ellie from the last of us, and GLaDOS (just to get a female villain in there). She shrugged this off by saying it’s still not enough because male protagonist characters outnumber female characters in video games. I feel like she wouldn’t be happy unless the numbers of male and female characters are exactly equal.

The second, and main issue I had with her argument is even if all female characters were represented as weak and helpless, I sincerely doubt there is any correlation between these characters and real world issues for women. For me video games are make believe, fiction, and stories. They’re imaginary worlds with imaginary characters. Saying the portrayal of women in video games perpetuates real societal problems for women (like pay inequality) is about as absurd to me as saying violence in video games perpetuates violence in real life, which from what I can tell [has been thoroughly debunked](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-33466-001/). Most reasonable people realize that women don’t wear bright pink dresses, pick vegetables with faces out of the ground, and get kidnapped from a giant turtle/dinosaur hybrid.

I provided my argument, and also said if Mario’s and Peach’s roles were reversed I could seriously not care less, as long as the game was still fun. Her response was “You won’t ever understand because you’re a guy.” I tried to continue on the debate but was met with the same response every time: “You won’t ever understand because you’re a guy.”

So here I am trying to change my view, while I may not agree with the feminist issue of women in video games, I feel like I’m more empathetic than what my girlfriend is giving me credit for. Have there been studies done about the portrayal of women in video games/stories and their effects on society? Is there any hard evidence for this correlation? 

EDIT: Yes, I get it, some people's feelings are hurt that Princess Peach is portrayed the way she is, and while making people upset IS a negative effect, this is not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for more of an impact than ""It's bad cause ma feelings are hurt""

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","I study media representations a little bit and might be able to address the points you raise.

You first point, that there are a ton of bad-ass female characters, may seem subjectively true but in the general demographic context of video games it is incorrect. There are certainly quite a few notable examples of bad-ass female characters but, in general, females are dramatically underrepresented in video games. A [content analysis of 150 video games from 2009](http://nms.sagepub.com/content/11/5/815.abstract) found that 85% of all video game characters were male. Of the 15% of characters that are female, the ""bad-ass"" characters are most definitely the exception. And even the ""bad-ass"" female characters are often still portrayed in highly gendered and sexualized ways. So even though you can call to mind several examples of non-helpless female characters, the fact remains that females are dramatically underrepresented and non-helpless female characters are only a portion of the already small number of female characters in video games. So, I don't think saying there are ""a ton of bad-ass female characters"" is an accurate reflection of actual video game demographics.

Your second point will probably be the more difficult one to change your mind about. You doubt that there is any connection between the way women are portrayed in video games and the way people think about and behave towards women in real life. Without getting too academic, I'll say that every person can be thought of as the result of a whole bunch of psychological and cultural ingredients. Some ingredients predispose a person to be a certain way and do certain things, while other ingredients do the opposite or cancel out effects. What this means is that it's never as simple as saying ""exposure to sexualized women will make someone a hostile sexist"" or ""exposure to violent video games will cause someone to be a violent criminal."" There are way too many other things going on to be able to make such a direct causal statement. However, repeated exposure to certain things most definitely changes the way you think about them, and these changes in the way you think about things then becomes one of the ingredients that makes you who you are and influences what you do. 

For an academic look at how we are all products and perpetuators of the society's we're part of the products we create and consume, read [this](http://web.stanford.edu/~hazelm/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2010-Markus-Kitayama_Culture-and-Self-A-cycle-of-mutual-constitution.pdf).

So with that said, let's talk about evidence that the media we consume can change the way we think about things. In another comment here, /u/fluffhoof mentions [this study](https://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2013/fox-chb-sexualized-virtual-selves.pdf) about the psychological effects of embodying a sexualized avatar. As a contrast to the single study you shared about violent video game effects, a [meta-analysis of studies examining the effects of violent video games](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20192553) found that playing violent video games was related to increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect, as well as decreased empathy and prosocial behavior. There are plenty of other examples where these come from and they all suggest that the kind of media we're exposed to can have real effects on the way we think about ourselves, and certain people and issues. Just because you don't become a hostile sexist or violent criminal after playing video games doesn't mean that they didn't have an effect on you.

Most of us probably have enough other ingredients in us that have to do with being egalitarian and reasonable and peaceful or whatever else, that the effects of exposure to this kind of media don't manifest themselves in obvious ways. But if you are repeatedly exposed to portrayals of women as helpless and sexualized, you will most likely think of women differently than if you hadn't been repeatedly exposed to those portrayals. And even if the only effect that exposure to these portrayals has on us is that we accept these portrayals as ""good"" or ""normal"" or ""typical of women"" or even just ""not unusual"" or ""not bad"" then it does a disservice to women in society by continuing to limit the way women are perceived and allowing the cycle of biased representations to continue.

Also, your girlfriend's point that ""you won't ever understand because you're a guy"" is absolutely true. You (if you're a male living almost anywhere in the world) have lived your life in a world where men are abundantly represented in real life and the media. Not only that but men are portrayed in a huge variety of ways: in positions of power, prestige, and notoriety as well as in positions of poverty, shame, and powerlessness, and so on. The point is that men have long enjoyed a very wide spectrum of representation, meaning that when someone thinks ""What is a man like?"" there is ample information to draw from and one can selectively draw from information that portrays men favorably. Women (and minorities) do not have that experience. Women are underrepresented in most media and they are represented in much narrower and limited ways than men are. So when one asks the question ""What is a woman like?"" the information one draws from is likely to be more scarce and more biased and this is likely to contribute to the perpetuation of people thinking that women are different than men in ways that they really aren't.

I get it if my arguments for subtle media effects having important consequences for society are hard to buy into. I get that a lot. One way or another, thanks for reading! :)","It is not easy (for me at the moment at least) to find studies that look at how representation in media influences how we think about and treat certain groups or how certain groups behave and think about themselves. 
For many people it is obvious that if for example a little black kid sees that the hero in the movies he watches is always a white guy, and people that look like him are only side-characters that might influence (not determine) the way he thinks about himself, the things he considers himself capable of and the things he goes on to pursue. And that media also influences what other people think he is capable of. Same could be said for representation of gender. This goes not only for movies but media in general. 

The expectation we have of certain groups (gender, race, orientation etc.) come largely from the society we life in and the things we perceive as normal or given. The alternative would be that we are born or naturally develop gender roles or stereotypes even without any interaction, to me that seems highly unlikely. I don't think that we are able to form our subconscious biases only by real world interaction without even being influenced by 'imaginary' content, like for example video games. 

However, you are right, that just because something seems obvious that doesn't mean that we don't need to go searching for scientific proof. 

Here is one study that I could find; 
&gt;To give one example of this effect, we know that (for reason not relevant here) women and minorities are underrepresented in media especially when it comes to characters that are professionally successful. There was a study done ""that finds evidence of a self-esteem boosting effect of television for white boys, but self-esteem damaging effects for white girls, black girls, and black boys.  One primary reason?  White boys see lots of white boys and men in the shows they watch.  And, not just that, but they regularly see these characters and actors in positive, powerful, and central roles."" ([quote](http://egrollman.com/2012/09/24/representation/), [source](http://crx.sagepub.com/content/39/3/338.abstract)). 

A quote from a [2000 paper](http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/538/art%253A10.1023%252FA%253A1007046204478.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1023%2FA%3A1007046204478&amp;token2=exp=1436542114~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F538%2Fart%25253A10.1023%25252FA%25253A1007046204478.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1023%252FA%253A1007046204478*~hmac=51f00906ba32d92292afd3dd80b6cca77d2c421d643bfd535be5c938b2c083ac) I could find that explains the process of how media might influence stereotypes:
&gt;Media analysts often use the concept of ‘‘frame’’ to explain how television imagery influences people (Entman, 1993; Gamson, Croteau, Hoynes, &amp; Sasson, 1992; Gitlin, 1980; Goffman, 1974). Although recent audience studies reveal that viewers do not automatically mimic what they see on television, the imagery they observe facilitates specific forms of understanding, interpretation, and experience (Press, 1991). Media images provide a diffuse confirmation of one’s world view, promote acceptance of current social arrangements, and reassure people that things are the way they ought to be. In social psychological terms, media images become incorporated into cognitive schema and heuristics, and are called up during processes of identity formation, self-evaluation, attribution, and social comparison. 

In the absence of more prove (that I could find) you could read up on the psychological process of stereotype development and schemata and decide for yourself if you think it is likely that these things are influenced by media. You could also talk to people with little children and ask them about how their kids react to representation in media or look online for people describing their experience. 

So far, you haven't been delivered absolute scientific prove. However, I'm also not aware of proof of the opposite viewpoint that representation does *not* influence us. Given that representation is indeed very poor for women and minorities (there's lots of scientific proof for *that*) and that many people are upset with this and wish it were better I at least see no reason to argue for the contrary.

"Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be ""free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't mean freedom from consequences from everyone else"". If it's on the internet it is equally likely that this [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1357/) will be shown. This does seem at first to be a reasonable point of view. However, I believe it is flawed for several related reasons.

The first reason is that underestimates the power of the public. Just because the state is not infringing your right does not mean others cannot. With other rights this is accepted as part of the system. For instance, if a company refused to serve or allow access to black people that would be considered a violation of their rights despite it not being the government. In the same way, you couldn't claim a country has gender equality if women can't be get a job, despite there being no law against hiring women. Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech.

Secondly, the right to free speech includes the right to unimpeded free speech, if that makes sense. It is not enough to be allowed to say what you want, you have to be allowed to communicate to who you want. It makes more tense in terms of letters. Freedom of speech is not fulfilled by allowing me to write letters, it is only fulfilled by allowing their delivery. Using the example from the comic, continually showing someone the door is the same as standing by the pillar box and shredding the letters as I post them.

The final reason is that extreme reactions to someone's use of free speech can restrict it by effectively punishing them for exercising their right. If I punched someone for suggesting marmite was a valid option for toast, would I not be restricting their right to free speech? Equally, if I was sacked for making a racist reddit post, am I not being punished for exercising my right to freedom of speech? I'm not entirely convinced on this point because it might restrict someone else's freedom of speech to criticise or their freedom of association to not have to put up with me, but I would still say there is some validity to this point.

Just to be clear, I don't think freedom of speech should never be restricted but I do think those restrictions should be acknowledged which the phrase ""freedom of speech, not freedom from consequences"" does not. 

Edit: This has been quite an intense discussion. I'm beginning to think there is too much free speech. Seriously though, there has been a lot of good comments and I'll try to respond as quick as I can, although that may be tomorrow for some. I haven't missed the irony of the downvote button being used to disagree on topic about free speech, but I suppose there's always one. I have given out two deltas so far, but they tangential so the bulk of the view remains unchanged as I write this edit.

Some people seem to be confused about what I mean by a private entity. I simply mean someone who isn't the state or acting as an agent of the state. I never meant to imply that I would start talking shit in your living room. Freedom of speech doesn't make crimes less illegal do to be clear I'm not advocating that in the slightest.

Edit 3: Some people seem to be under the impression I want to expand the laws regarding free speech, probably because I'm a neo-Nazi Grand Dragon or something. That's not the case. I think the current situation I more than satisfactory. My view relates to the opinions towards free speech. To sum it up more succinctly, I don't think people can claim to be pro-free speech, when society is more than willing to restrict it. I'm *not* saying the restrictions are bad, I'm saying people should be more honest about them.

A lot of the comments have struggled with what the view is, despite it being repeated multiple times. I'm not interested in acting as reading adviser. If your comment doesn't address the view, I'm not going to bother responding.

/u/Vordreller found this bastardised version of the [comic](http://sealedabstract.com/rants/re-xkcd-1357-free-speech/), and from John Stuart Mill onwards, I agree with the sentiments the creator expresses. If you want to see my argument in comic form, you couldn't get much closer than that.

Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech.

The major distinction I see here is that race, gender, sexuality, etc., those are all things that a person can't control those things about themselves. You can't decide not to be black or a woman or gay or whatever for a while because you're around people who don't like those types of people.

The short answer is no. You can say whatever you want. You can't however say what you want and expect others not to react to your words. I can't go to my friends house and say that his wife is a cunt and expect to be invited over next week. I can't tell my employer that I feel that black people are inferior to whites and then expect to represent my boss by wearing his company's name badge to work.

In the same way, you couldn't claim a country has gender equality if women can't be get a job, despite there being no law against hiring women. Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech.

The major distinction I see here is that race, gender, sexuality, etc., those are all things that a person can't control those things about themselves. You can't decide not to be black or a woman or gay or whatever for a while because you're around people who don't like those types of people.

"I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have lived/currently live there, I could not be more dead set against ever moving there. In fact, I have come to despise that place. As a quick note about the perspective I have: I'm a 3rd-year law student. I grew up in South FL, and currently live in Boston, MA. I'm not a stranger to life in a northeastern American city; maybe city life in general is not for me, although I do like Boston *much* better than New York. 

First, it's filthy. There is trash *everywhere*, the water is polluted, and the air simply does not smell clean. Being an old Northeastern city, it's filled with old buildings, many of which are in varying degrees of disrepair. It's just generally a dirty, sad place for me to be. 

It's also crowded. NYC has ~8.5 million people crammed into around 300 square miles. To walk anywhere, you must wade through a sea of drab, disheveled humanity. The public transit is packed. Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I've ever had.   

The cost of living is exorbitant, as everyone already knows. Rent alone takes up most of my friends' paychecks, and their places aren't even that nice or spacious. New Yorkers seem like they pay through the nose for a standard of living that ain't that great.

Then there's the climate. The winters are frigid and soul-crushing, complete with biting wind and extended periods of low sunlight or darkness. The summers are sweltering, and the heat only exacerbates the ever-present smell of rotting garbage. Plus, central air is apparently only for the wealthy northeasterners, because it is conspicuously scarce in most homes/apartments I've visited. 

I can't understand the allure of that city. The wealthy live comfortable lives while most everyone else pays through the nose to live wretchedly. People get an inexplicable sense of self-importance and accomplishment simply by moving there and living there for a bit, regardless of what they're doing. Maybe I'd feel accomplished too, if I paid $800/month to live in a cardboard box and resisted the temptation to commit suicide by antagonizing the psychotic, fascist police to which NYC is a home. 

TL;DR NYC is a crowded, dirty, dismal place and I cannot ever picture myself being happy there. CMV. 


Edit: I'm well aware of the shitty aspects of Boston life; to me, NYC's bads are more...well, *bad* than Boston's, that's my point. Also, inb4 ""hurr Florida has bad things about it too."" I definitely know that's true!

Edit 2: FOLKS, this post isn't about ""Boston &gt; NYC""; I'm well aware that there are bad parts about Boston too. Pointing out bad shit about other cities doesn't help make the case for NY.

&gt; There is trash everywhere, the water is polluted, and the air simply does not smell clean. 

There are plenty clean and nice spots in the city. I was just at [Gentry State Park](http://cityphile.com/photo/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Gantry-State-Park-4897.jpg), where I didn't see any litter and even saw some people kayaking on the East River during sunset. I'm originally from Queens, where there are plenty of quiet, nice-smelling neighborhoods.[ Forest Hills](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Forest_Hills_Gardens,_Queens,_NY.jpg), for instance, is a pretty woodsy neighborhood with a really nice suburban area. Doesn't smell like shit. You just have to get out of Manhattan.

&gt; It's also crowded. NYC has ~8.5 million people crammed into around 300 square miles. To walk anywhere, you must wade through a sea of drab, disheveled humanity. The public transit is packed. Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I've ever had.

I'll admit, NYC can feel a bit crowded when you're on a packed train trying to commute to work, but otherwise, I've not experienced having to wade through crowds of people on a regular basis. And if I do, I wouldn't call the typical New York resident a member of ""drab, disheveled humanity"". In fact, some of us are quite good-looking and take pride in our hygiene. 

&gt; The cost of living is exorbitant.

Salaries are adjusted to the cost of living, to some small degree. But you're probably still thinking of Manhattan (and some trendy parts of Brooklyn). When you go out into the outer boroughs, rent can easily go down to 700/600/500 per month, which isn't terrible. When you weigh the cost of living in a small space to the availability of basically everything (i.e. food, nightlife, cultural institutions, people, schools, etc.), then I would say lots of people would give up a front yard to live in a place of diversity and activity.

This is undeniably true.

Moved in a few months ago from a small CT town and would like to provide my input as I have fallen in love with my City and Neighborhood. 

Your first point, ""It's filthy and old and in disrepair.""  Since you don't live here you may not understand that many of the buildings that look like they're in disrepair are actually some of the most hip and interesting places. For example, My office building is an old Brass Factory in Williamsburg Brooklyn and from the outside it kinda looks abandoned, but walk in and you'll see that it has a very aesthetically pleasing interior. Don't judge a book by its cover. On top of that, yes NYC is an old city, therefor it has a rich history resulting in an overwhelming appreciation and desire for vintage styles/fashion/lifestyles/art/etc.. That's why I believe Brooklyn and other parts of NYC have been deemed a Hipster hub. Old, doesn't always mean bad. For the trash, yes, there are parts that are more dirty than others, but much of the city is really clean too. I think your experience with the trash might be a bit narrow minded.  

It's crowded. Yes, yes it is and thats a beautiful thing. I always get an appreciating for the human race when I'm walking through a sea of people because it's an achievement to be able to sustain so many people in such a small area. Also, those Disheveled/drab people are also some of the smartest and most innovative people in the nation.  On top of that NYC is probably one of the most diverse and ethnically accepting cities in the world. With all these people comes exposure to new cultures, rituals, food, outlooks on life, etc. 

Cost of living is high and salaries reflect that. The average salary for a particular job in NYC is higher than other places. Rent is so expensive, but you're not paying so much to sleep in a small apartment but rather paying to be so close to all the action. There is so much to experience that if you're staying in Mon-Fri, you're not doing NYC right. 

Climate. Boston just had record snow falls and a much harsher winter than us. The heat, just comes with the north east. In the summer, it's always humid and hot. That's not just for NYC, thats everywhere. The smell of garbage can be a problem and it's most prevalent in the subway systems, where it can get uncomfortably hot, but this is mostly in the touristy areas of the city where non-residents think it's ok to liter. I've seen tourists litter waaaaayyyyy more often than residents who have an appreciation for their city. 

It seems like you're mostly describing parts of Manhattan. I invite you to come to my Neighborhood in Brooklyn. PM me when you're in the city next and I'll treat you to an immaculate cuisine and unforgettable night that you'll only be able to experience here.

"Why I hold this view:

1.  America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.

2. Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda executed a brutal plan to orchestrate the 9/11 attacks. [According to them, their major motivation was to end the presence of US in gulf countries and other motives as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks#Motives) For this purpose they chose to ram airplanes in the WTC  &amp; Pentagon to achieve maximum civilian casualties and make a frightening spectacle for the US public. The ends justify the means seems to be their reasoning. Was Al-Qaeda &amp; Co justified in perpetrating 9/11? 
No one would say yes.

     If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths. 


3. Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.

4. The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared. How do we even know the outcome of Operation Downfall? Moreover Japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the Secretary Of War, Henry Louis Stimson agreed: 

“Japan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.”


We erased two cities and its people from history. We dehumanized them, reduced them to a statistic. W[e even censored images and stories of the Japanese victims to push the narrative in our direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Depiction.2C_public_response_and_censorship). At least the Government should officially apologize to the nation of Japan.
","I think its important to remember when reviewing history, that we not use modern notions of morality and hindsight to judge the actions of those in the past without understanding the context those decisions were made, which includes the morals and norms of the day, and the physical evidence they had available.

Every time the atomic bombs are mentioned, it seems like people keep bringing up the same arguments about how the atomic bombs were unnecessary. About how these were intended to kill civilians and were unnecessary since Japan was going to surrender anyways.

None of these, however, take into account what the decision makers had to deal with at the time, nor do they take into account the facts about Japan's situation at the time.

The whole talk about how the bombs were unnecessary and that Japan was seeking to surrender forgets that Japan didn't surrender despite given multiple chances. On July 26th, the Allies in Europe already issued the Potsdam Declaration, demanding Japan's immediate and unconditional surrender - something the Allies wanted to ensure they could never have a repeat of Germany's rise after WWI which caused WWII. Two of the points here:

&gt;Point 10: We do not intend that the Japanese shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners. The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established.
&gt;
&gt;Point 13: We call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction.

Not only did the Japanese refuse this unconditional surrender, but Japan thought it could broker a peace with the US through the Soviet Union which was already preparing its invasion of Japan, to honor its agreement to declare war on Japan within 100 days of its victory over Germany.

In addition, the power struggle in Japan's government means that civilian government overtures to the Americans held little weight. The Japanese military government was the de facto power in Japan and often overruled the civilian government.

Furthermore, the civilian government simply wasn't trusted by the US or any Allied nations. The Americans remembered that on the afternoon of December 7, Japanese diplomat Kurusu delivered Japan's reply closing with the statement that ""The immutable policy of Japan is to promote world peace."" He didn't know, due to the lag in communications, that at that moment, the bombing of Pearl Harbor had already commenced. What diplomatic integrity did Japan have in the eyes of the nations they had attacked at that point?

Aerial and naval reconnaissance of the Japanese home islands showed that the Japanese were digging in and preparing for an invasion. These diplomatic overtures were often seen as just stall tactics in order to better fortify the Japanese home islands to make an invasion less appealing, and thus give better terms for a brokered peace, which was the last thing the Allies wanted. In fact, the Allies knew that Japan had tried that strategy before – the whole point of the attack on Pearl Harbor was to buy time for the Japanese to implement their defenses in the Pacific in the hopes that it would make an American counter-offensive unpalatable. 

Speaking of an invasion, Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan, was planned to commence in less than 100 days. The pre-invasion aerial and naval bombardment was scheduled for late October, and Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu was set for X-Day, November 1st. 

The estimates for the death toll of an invasion of Japan were tremendous. This isn't some post-war revisionist estimates either - the military had estimated casualties based on the ever-rising death toll as the US got closer to the Japanese home islands. On Iwo Jima, for instance, only 216 of the 21,000 Japanese defenders surrendered. The US suffered over 6,700 killed and another 20,000 wounded in 35 days of fighting for *8 square miles* of island.

Okinawa was even more horrendous - over 12,000 Americans were killed, another 55,000 wounded, and 38 ships lost in just 88 days of fighting. The Japanese suffered even more - over 77,000 killed with another 100,000+ civilians killed on those islands. That’s estimated to be a third of the civilian population of Okinawa. Now extrapolate that Kyushu, with its much higher population and highly populated cities (urban combat is notoriously deadly - over 200,000 were killed in 16 days in the Battle of Berlin), and any estimate is going to start in the hundreds of thousands killed.

The alternative to an invasion, of course, was to blockade Japan and starve its people to death. This would take time - and would ultimately have killed even more Japanese than the bombings would have, as history’s famines have shown time and again. Famine isn’t just discriminate – it disproportionately targets the weak, elderly, and young who would die first. Likewise, with food rations given to soldiers as a priority, civilians would have been disproportionately affected even further.

Thus, the atomic bombs were to be part of the series of aerial bombardment raids designed to cripple Japan's ability to fight and hopefully force a surrender before the invasion was necessary. The US had already done firebombing, such as the raid over Tokyo which killed more people than the atomic bombs did, as part of this same strategic bombing campaign.

The atomic bombs were thus viewed as a new and more efficient way to carry out the campaign. Keep in mind that all the negative focus on nuclear weapons of today is borne entirely out of our experience with nuclear weapons from these bombings AND from the decades of the Cold War. The very concept of nuclear weapons being unfathomable to use in war didn’t exist in 1945, and one could argue, largely came about precisely because these weapons were used.

And for all the people that say the US wanted to kill indiscriminately, the fact is, the US dropped leaflets on over 30 cities in Japan in the weeks and months before the atomic bombings, warning Japanese civilians to evacuate their cities. They even very specifically mention that they are not targeting civilians, but the installations and workshops and factories of war.

The Japanese text on the reverse side of one of the leaflets dropped carried the following warning:

&gt; “Read this carefully as it may save your life or the life of a relative or friend. In the next few days, some or all of the cities named on the reverse side will be destroyed by American bombs. These cities contain military installations and workshops or factories which produce military goods. We are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique which they are using to prolong this useless war. 
&gt;
&gt;But, unfortunately, bombs have no eyes. So, in accordance with America's humanitarian policies, the American Air Force, which does not wish to injure innocent people, now gives you warning to evacuate the cities named and save your lives. America is not fighting the Japanese people but is fighting the military clique which has enslaved the Japanese people. The peace which America will bring will free the people from the oppression of the military clique and mean the emergence of a new and better Japan. 
&gt;
&gt;You can restore peace by demanding new and good leaders who will end the war. We cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked but some or all of them will be, so heed this warning and evacuate these cities immediately.”

Chilling to read those words, even today.

The bombing of Hiroshima, however, was met with silence from the Japanese. As thus, the US proceeded again with the bombing of Nagasaki. Why a second one? 

Simply because that was part of the strategy laid out to get Japan to surrender - the US would use atomic bombs as they were manufactured and became available. Keep in mind that during this time, the US could not mass-produce atomic weapons like it ended up being capable of doing in the Cold War. The centrifuges simply weren't up to the quality and ability of years later, and so early on, they were only able to manufacture one or two bombs a month. Nagasaki was the second and last of the bombs available – the next one wouldn’t be ready for use for more another week with planners estimating the US having only 7 total available by the time of X-Day.

Thus it wasn't about dropping a second bomb to be punitive – it was dropped because a second one was available. In other words, the plan was to eventually use the bombs continually until Japan surrendered or the invasion began in which case the bombs would then continue to fall in direct support of the troops until Japanese capitulation.

And still, even with the Soviet entry into the war against Japan, there was silence and even resistance to surrender. An attempted coup against the Japanese emperor was tried but failed, and the Emperor made his famous broadcast to the Japanese people declaring his decision to surrender. In it, he very specifically mentions the atomic bombs, to which I conclude:

&gt;Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should We continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.
","&gt; America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.

The other way of ending the war was a full scale land invasion, which would have resulted in many more casualties and destruction than what the final atomic bombings caused.

[Japan was in no mood to surrender prior to this, or even after the first bombing.](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/the-pacific-war-1941-to-1945/operation-downfall/)

The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths.

YOu're completely ignoring the major military significance of those cities.

Hiroshima was a major army depot with many military headquarters, Nagasaki was a major industrial and port city home to many of the nation's war efforts, that had already been targeted before.

Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they?

[Everybody was attacking civilian targets in WW2.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II).  When nations go to war, that is what happens.

&gt; The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared.

You have no way of knowing that civilians would have been spared, they could just have easily have been conscripted to fight.

The Japanese had time and again shown that they *would not* surrender. [That they would candidly fight to the death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima), in Saipan [civilians killed themselves to avoid capture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saipan#Civilian_casualties)

&gt; “Japan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.”

And despite all that, they still refused to surrender. At some point, you have to acknowledge that the Japanese have culpability for some of this as well.

[To single out the atomic bombings as some kind of extra-inhumane effort on behalf of the USA, is little odd, given that our conventional air raids did much more damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raids_on_Japan)",26,"I think its important to remember when reviewing history, that we not use modern notions of morality and hindsight to judge the actions of those in the past without understanding the context those decisions were made, which includes the morals and norms of the day, and the physical evidence they had available.

Every time the atomic bombs are mentioned, it seems like people keep bringing up the same arguments about how the atomic bombs were unnecessary. About how these were intended to kill civilians and were unnecessary since Japan was going to surrender anyways.

None of these, however, take into account what the decision makers had to deal with at the time, nor do they take into account the facts about Japan's situation at the time.

The whole talk about how the bombs were unnecessary and that Japan was seeking to surrender forgets that Japan didn't surrender despite given multiple chances. On July 26th, the Allies in Europe already issued the Potsdam Declaration, demanding Japan's immediate and unconditional surrender - something the Allies wanted to ensure they could never have a repeat of Germany's rise after WWI which caused WWII. Two of the points here:

&gt;Point 10: We do not intend that the Japanese shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners. The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established.
&gt;
&gt;Point 13: We call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction.

Not only did the Japanese refuse this unconditional surrender, but Japan thought it could broker a peace with the US through the Soviet Union which was already preparing its invasion of Japan, to honor its agreement to declare war on Japan within 100 days of its victory over Germany.

In addition, the power struggle in Japan's government means that civilian government overtures to the Americans held little weight. The Japanese military government was the de facto power in Japan and often overruled the civilian government.

Furthermore, the civilian government simply wasn't trusted by the US or any Allied nations. The Americans remembered that on the afternoon of December 7, Japanese diplomat Kurusu delivered Japan's reply closing with the statement that ""The immutable policy of Japan is to promote world peace."" He didn't know, due to the lag in communications, that at that moment, the bombing of Pearl Harbor had already commenced. What diplomatic integrity did Japan have in the eyes of the nations they had attacked at that point?

Aerial and naval reconnaissance of the Japanese home islands showed that the Japanese were digging in and preparing for an invasion. These diplomatic overtures were often seen as just stall tactics in order to better fortify the Japanese home islands to make an invasion less appealing, and thus give better terms for a brokered peace, which was the last thing the Allies wanted. In fact, the Allies knew that Japan had tried that strategy before – the whole point of the attack on Pearl Harbor was to buy time for the Japanese to implement their defenses in the Pacific in the hopes that it would make an American counter-offensive unpalatable. 

Speaking of an invasion, Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan, was planned to commence in less than 100 days. The pre-invasion aerial and naval bombardment was scheduled for late October, and Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu was set for X-Day, November 1st. 

The estimates for the death toll of an invasion of Japan were tremendous. This isn't some post-war revisionist estimates either - the military had estimated casualties based on the ever-rising death toll as the US got closer to the Japanese home islands. On Iwo Jima, for instance, only 216 of the 21,000 Japanese defenders surrendered. The US suffered over 6,700 killed and another 20,000 wounded in 35 days of fighting for *8 square miles* of island.

Okinawa was even more horrendous - over 12,000 Americans were killed, another 55,000 wounded, and 38 ships lost in just 88 days of fighting. The Japanese suffered even more - over 77,000 killed with another 100,000+ civilians killed on those islands. That’s estimated to be a third of the civilian population of Okinawa. Now extrapolate that Kyushu, with its much higher population and highly populated cities (urban combat is notoriously deadly - over 200,000 were killed in 16 days in the Battle of Berlin), and any estimate is going to start in the hundreds of thousands killed.

The alternative to an invasion, of course, was to blockade Japan and starve its people to death. This would take time - and would ultimately have killed even more Japanese than the bombings would have, as history’s famines have shown time and again. Famine isn’t just discriminate – it disproportionately targets the weak, elderly, and young who would die first. Likewise, with food rations given to soldiers as a priority, civilians would have been disproportionately affected even further.

Thus, the atomic bombs were to be part of the series of aerial bombardment raids designed to cripple Japan's ability to fight and hopefully force a surrender before the invasion was necessary. The US had already done firebombing, such as the raid over Tokyo which killed more people than the atomic bombs did, as part of this same strategic bombing campaign.

The atomic bombs were thus viewed as a new and more efficient way to carry out the campaign. Keep in mind that all the negative focus on nuclear weapons of today is borne entirely out of our experience with nuclear weapons from these bombings AND from the decades of the Cold War. The very concept of nuclear weapons being unfathomable to use in war didn’t exist in 1945, and one could argue, largely came about precisely because these weapons were used.

And for all the people that say the US wanted to kill indiscriminately, the fact is, the US dropped leaflets on over 30 cities in Japan in the weeks and months before the atomic bombings, warning Japanese civilians to evacuate their cities. They even very specifically mention that they are not targeting civilians, but the installations and workshops and factories of war.

The Japanese text on the reverse side of one of the leaflets dropped carried the following warning:

&gt; “Read this carefully as it may save your life or the life of a relative or friend. In the next few days, some or all of the cities named on the reverse side will be destroyed by American bombs. These cities contain military installations and workshops or factories which produce military goods. We are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique which they are using to prolong this useless war. 
&gt;
&gt;But, unfortunately, bombs have no eyes. So, in accordance with America's humanitarian policies, the American Air Force, which does not wish to injure innocent people, now gives you warning to evacuate the cities named and save your lives. America is not fighting the Japanese people but is fighting the military clique which has enslaved the Japanese people. The peace which America will bring will free the people from the oppression of the military clique and mean the emergence of a new and better Japan. 
&gt;
&gt;You can restore peace by demanding new and good leaders who will end the war. We cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked but some or all of them will be, so heed this warning and evacuate these cities immediately.”

Chilling to read those words, even today.

The bombing of Hiroshima, however, was met with silence from the Japanese. As thus, the US proceeded again with the bombing of Nagasaki. Why a second one? 

Simply because that was part of the strategy laid out to get Japan to surrender - the US would use atomic bombs as they were manufactured and became available. Keep in mind that during this time, the US could not mass-produce atomic weapons like it ended up being capable of doing in the Cold War. The centrifuges simply weren't up to the quality and ability of years later, and so early on, they were only able to manufacture one or two bombs a month. Nagasaki was the second and last of the bombs available – the next one wouldn’t be ready for use for more another week with planners estimating the US having only 7 total available by the time of X-Day.

Thus it wasn't about dropping a second bomb to be punitive – it was dropped because a second one was available. In other words, the plan was to eventually use the bombs continually until Japan surrendered or the invasion began in which case the bombs would then continue to fall in direct support of the troops until Japanese capitulation.

And still, even with the Soviet entry into the war against Japan, there was silence and even resistance to surrender. An attempted coup against the Japanese emperor was tried but failed, and the Emperor made his famous broadcast to the Japanese people declaring his decision to surrender. In it, he very specifically mentions the atomic bombs, to which I conclude:

&gt;Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should We continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.
","&gt; America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.

The other way of ending the war was a full scale land invasion, which would have resulted in many more casualties and destruction than what the final atomic bombings caused.

[Japan was in no mood to surrender prior to this, or even after the first bombing.](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/the-pacific-war-1941-to-1945/operation-downfall/)

&gt; If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths.

YOu're completely ignoring the major military significance of those cities.

Hiroshima was a major army depot with many military headquarters, Nagasaki was a major industrial and port city home to many of the nation's war efforts, that had already been targeted before.

&gt; Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they?

"The US Constitution was written at a time when states believed they needed a check on federal power. Requiring a body that represented all states equally to pass any legislation seemed to preserve those rights.

However, this attitude is mostly archaic today. Representing every state equally allows small states disproportionate power in matters pertaining to the whole country. Why should they be able to block the rest of the country's people from deciding on federal matters? It's essentially saying that voters in North Dakota, Vermont and Alaska are more important than elsewhere.

If you can find me a purpose for the US Senate as an actual decision-making body in today's day and age, and not just as a vastly unrepresentative body that has the power to completely kill legislation that most Americans support, please CMV.

"In much the same way as drugs, prostitution, gambling, or other ""victimless"" crimes, dog fighting is going to happen irrespective of the law.  Legalization would lead to increased tax revenue, less organized crime. and safer, more humane environments for all those involved.  It would also end the practice of baiting game dogs with helpless puppies and the like.

I understand that many would argue that the dogs are victims (as are drug addicts and prostitutes for that matter), but only in the sense that eating horse meat (which is illegal in many places) victimizes horses, or even horse racing, which is already legalized, taxed, and regulated in controlled environments.

The fact is countless dogs are already being put to death in animal shelters, often at the taxpayers' expense.  Revenue from dog fighting could alleviate this cost considerably, perhaps even allowing animals to be kept longer, increasing their chances of adoption.  Highly aggressive dogs are unlikely to ever be adopted however (except perhaps by illegal dog-fighting fans currently), nor should they be.  

It would only be the aggressive dogs used in fights, as they're clearly willing. That's why they need to be kept in separate cages, otherwise they'd be mauling each other of their own volition.  Dogs too old, young, sickly, or cowardly to fight could still be put down as usual since they would make for unentertaining match-ups and would be bad for gambling.

Even the dogs that do fight would receive better medical treatment afterwards from veterinarians on hand, and/or humane euthanasia rather than drowning, hanging, etc.  You certainly wouldn't get the likes of a Michael Vick doing a Pete Townshend impression with a terrier in place of a guitar.

"I hate driving. One of the main reasons is (aside from being kind of a shitty driver myself), I feel like turning your head 135 degrees to check your blind spot is extremely dangerous, even though it's part of the standard procedure for changing into another lane. This is especially bad now that I've got a [Madza 3](http://images.newcars.com/images/car-pictures/original/2014-Mazda-Mazda3-Sedan-i-SV-4dr-Sedan-Photo-3.png), since the backseat windows are so high up that I have to crane my neck and can barely make out what's going on in my blind spot anyways. Also, having to turn my head to such a wide angle means there's a lot more time when my eyes aren't in front of me, on the road ahead.

I understand that it's absolutely essential to make sure there's nobody in your blind spot. But there's lots of solutions that allow you to use mirrors to check instead, among them being

- [adjusting your sideviews to incorporate the blind spot](http://www.caranddriver.com/features/how-to-adjust-your-mirrors-to-avoid-blind-spots)
- [buying one of these](http://www.amazon.com/Fit-System-C0400-Passenger-Adjustable/dp/B001DKT0DO/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436313257&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=blind+spot+mirror)

Both of these options let you keep at least your peripheral vision on the road and greatly reduces the time it takes you check your blind spot.

Edit: Apparently, I've been doing it wrong the whole time. You guys are right, there shouldn't be any reason to take 2 seconds to do a shoulder check - I tend to scan the whole rear side of my car instead of looking at a specific spot. Thanks for the responses, I'm gonna go on youtube now and figure out how to drive more properly","I think you might be doing the blind spot check wrong. You aren't supposed to scan the whole area. There is one specific spot, maybe 6 inches in diameter on each side that you are supposed to look at. It's a very fast process. 

The best way I can describe it is by relating it to video games. I don't know if you've ever played Counter-Strike, but there was a type of cheat called an aimbot. Whereas regular players would jump through a door and look around for players before starting to shoot, the aimbot already knew where the players were and automatically aimed the gun right at the other player's head. That's how you want your blind spot check to look. You look right at that one spot quickly and then go back to the road. You can take your time with it since you aren't wasting looks at places that are covered by your mirror.

Proper shoulder checks are irreplaceable. There is a very large blind spot in all cars, and many many accidents are caused by people not doing a proper shoulder check.

"**Edit:** I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas. 

Thanks

I don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. 

Suppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a ""creep"" for ""looking through"" her profile. 

I'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have ""good old days"".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as ""creeping someone's profile"" online. Putting aside when a ""profile"" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. 

So the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...

I feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them.

"**Update: So I think I kind of changed my view.. but also I feel like the discussion is running in circles a little which is probably not anyones fault but just the nature of the topic. The dog-biting problem might not be as bad as I perceived it to be, especially in public spaces. So one could argue that a leash and breeding documentation is enough to have appropiate security. I really don't trust leashes when I cross a dog on the walkway and I feel like owners are really lax about them where I live. This belongs in their responsibilty, though. Anyway, I really enjoyed the little discussion with you guys. I consider my first CMV to be quite succesful :) I'll be giving out Deltas as soon as I figured out how.In germany there is a movement that demands muzzles only for especially ""aggressive"" breeds of dogs and every dogs' origin should be tested. Sounds like a good compromise for me.**



Hello there. I'm no native speaker so please have mercy :)

After trying to be rational about this topic for a long time, I could only come up with the opinion stated in the headline. Dogs in public places with a jaw strong enough to harm children should always wear a muzzle. By law.

Here's my explanation:



Dog owners tend to trust their dogs and they trust themselves in knowing their dog's behaviour. 
They expose other people's integrity to their personal, arbitrary judgement call. 
Walking a dog in public, even on a leash, is essentially not different from holding a loaded gun in public without the intention to do harm. 
People would still avoid to be in shooting range. Why do people not shy away from dogs in the same way? 
This is because they've made good experiences with dogs before and therefore underestimate the potential danger by a great margin. People who have been bitten will usually never trust big dogs again and will find that they changed their mind a little too late.
Unmuzzled dogs on sidewalks or in parks are traumatic encounters for victims of dog bites.



There is also the problem of appropiate conviction. 

The guy who purposefully carried a loaded gun in public and then killed someone by slipping his finger is much easier to convict than a dog owner whose only mistake was a short lack of attention for his dog. Should the dog owner be convicted with manslaughter? 
I know I wouldn't be able to lock someone up for this long only because he didn't pay attention. This is because there was no law protecting the dog owner from endangering other people in the first place. The idiot carrying the gun knew he was breaking the law the moment he stepped out the door. The dog owner didn't.



After reading this you probably think that either I've been bitten by a dog or that I'm a dog-hating cat person. I'm neither. 

To be honest I think that muzzles on dogs look very sad and I would rather have a better soultion for all this. However, I have a huge hate for frivolous dog owners who think that because they're not scared of their dog, I shouldn't be either.


So please change my view. :)

"I realise that this is a meme one itself nowadays, but as a black man I have absolutely no sympathy for any redditor who was on coontown. These people hate me, and I hate them, plain and simple, and I am happy it made their lives even slightly worse. 

However, the main response to it from neutral people has been that it sets a bad precedent. But again, I don't care if all hate subreddits are banned. People have said that it is the issue of how to define what a hate subreddit is, but I just think that this is a diversionary argument of semantics. The difference between, say Coontown, and Shitredditsays is light and day, and anyone who says different needs to walk a mile in other peoples shoes. 

The final argument against seems to be that the banning of coontown was for reasons of brigading, and that this was wrong. If this is the case, then Shitredditsays should be banned too, and I certainly wouldn't miss it, but I really wouldn't argue that Coontown should be brought back. 

For obvious reasons.

More troublingly, it marks an immense change in reddit's policy; just a few years ago, during spez's last time in charge, he unequivocally stated that content would never be banned. Now?

"I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately attacking Rachael Dolezal afterwords. I felt both stories where instances of fluidity. One was on Gender Fluidity, the other being Ethnic Fluidity. Assuming Rachael actually feels much more comfortable as a black woman, I don't see why she should not be one. 

I understand that it might be seen as an unfair comparison to say a sex change has the same weight as an ethnic change, but I can't help but think this decision on who we can and cannot be should not rest on society, but rather on ourselves. If we allow this, then perhaps we would see questions of ""yes you have decided to be a girl, but are you the right kind of girl?"" or ""you believe to be a christian, but are you the right kind of christian? Oh, you are transferring from being a Buddhist? No, you can't do that, religion and spirituality isn't for you to decide.""

Now I know that these particular examples the best in this circumstance, but I guess I'm trying to get at what happens when we have society decide what is the ""right kind"" of race for you to be.  

TL;DR-
Caitlin Jenner didn't get flack for a similar transformation, and what this should come down to is an individuals right to be who they feel comfortable being, not who society wants them to be.

"I was just reading [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/35y0qf/cmv_some_opinions_are_ethically_right_and_can/) where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. 

I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be the most morally correct thing to do, and that the problem is doing it instead, since actually doing it would come with a price that you may not be prepared to pay, therefore saying that the moral thing to do is the opposite.

You might say that in the past century the moral compass has changed and yadda yadda, and we all know that it is simply not true. Morality never changed a bit.

What people are willing to do for morality has changed.

I expect some answers to clarify the concept of ""moral"", and I think it can be stated as ""the most moral action is the one that causes the least possible amount of grief"".","A few problems with this:

1: Your definition of morality isn't necessarily what is moral. I'm not sure if you've taken a philosophy class, but this is a common debate among philosophers. ""Causing the least amount of grief"" is utilitarian, which means that it tries to maximize  something generally perceived as good (I.e life, pleasure) or minimize something generally perceived as bad (suffering, death, or grief in this case). There are multiple schools of thought for and against this: for instance, deontology is the idea there are moral absolutes. For example, if you ask me where my family is so you can murder them, I am morally obligated to tell you where they are because lying on my part is inherently wrong. Some say that we have infinite obligation towards the ""other,"" or other people/ another person; so even if an action results in, say, extinction, if you ask me to do it for you I must do it, for you. Other commenters have already said that you can't calculate grief and pleasure, and some people react to things more or less than others. What this means is that, yes, your definition of utilitarian ideals is true, but in practice, it is not necessarily moral. 

2. Reality is subjective, which means everything, including morality, is also subjective. Subjective, according to my highly qualified Google search, is defined as ""based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions: dependent on the mind or on an individual's perception for its existence."" Think about it: people's personal opinions, perceptions, experiences, et cetera, shape how they view the world and what they think of it. Thus, our differences in views mean our realities and ideas are also subjective, and all our man-made thoughts, like those on morality are also subjective, meaning morality cannot be objective.

Hope I was able to change your view.

Philosophical work on morality:
Immanuel Kant, ""Critique of Pure Reason""
John Stuart Mill, ""Utilitarianism""
Soren Kierkegaard, ""Fear and Trembling""
Emmanuel Levinas, ""Totality and Infinity""","I'm not sure if this is against the rules but I'm going to say that both viewpoints are correct...from a subjective (lol) viewpoint. All people in the world clearly do not agree on a moral standard in all areas. Never have, never will. What is generally accepted to be right and wrong changes. Slavery for millennia was commonplace and not seen as wrong. Heck, Africans sold their own people into slavery. So in both of these senses, morality can be seen as subjective. 


Yet despite the opinions of the past, slavery is wrong. This is a fact. Mental gymnastics and culture was what tricked people into thinking it was OK. So in that sense there is an objective morality. Just because people don't agree or change opinions doesn't mean that truth does not exist. 


But then on the subjective side, there are very hard moral choices sometimes. Use a classic example, killing Hitler before he became a dictator. Is it wrong because it's murder or right because it saves lives? I'm such a case and in less extreme cases, there may not be an answer and it is up to the individual to decide their course of action, in other words, it is subjective. This may not make sense at first, but consider another dilemma. You have extra money to spend and can't decide whether you want to donate it to charity or buy your girlfriend a present. Is there really a wrong answer here? Would it be morally wrong to spend the money on yourself even? No. Therefore not all choices are as black and white as right and wrong. Even in the Hitler example, there is no wrong choice because we simply don't have enough information. Would killing him cause an alternate future that is  even worse? Would killing him solve every modern problem we have? There is no way to know without being an advanced time traveler or God. Therefore it is subjective to the individual to choose what seems best to them. 


However, if you chose to kill or not kill because you wanted to mess things up as much as possible, that WOULD be wrong. Sometimes our attitude is more important than the action itself. However, if you are unaware at age 42 that drinking in driving is illegal and all around bad idea and you drive drunk and kill someone, you should not be exempt from responsibility simply because you are an idiot. So in that sense morality is objective. 


So basically morality is complex, though it is spun to be more complex than it is, I agree with you. It is generally easy to determine whether something is right, wrong, or neutral. I have found many controversial topics to be controversial not for their complexity but because people are selfish and try to make it complex so they are justified. That said, some things truly are complex. ",34,"A few problems with this:

What this means is that, yes, your definition of utilitarian ideals is true, but in practice, it is not necessarily moral. 

2. Reality is subjective, which means everything, including morality, is also subjective. Subjective, according to my highly qualified Google search, is defined as ""based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions: dependent on the mind or on an individual's perception for its existence."" Think about it: people's personal opinions, perceptions, experiences, et cetera, shape how they view the world and what they think of it. Thus, our differences in views mean our realities and ideas are also subjective, and all our man-made thoughts, like those on morality are also subjective, meaning morality cannot be objective.

Hope I was able to change your view.

Philosophical work on morality:
Immanuel Kant, ""Critique of Pure Reason""
John Stuart Mill, ""Utilitarianism""
Soren Kierkegaard, ""Fear and Trembling""
Emmanuel Levinas, ""Totality and Infinity""","I'm not sure if this is against the rules but I'm going to say that both viewpoints are correct...from a subjective (lol) viewpoint. All people in the world clearly do not agree on a moral standard in all areas. Never have, never will. What is generally accepted to be right and wrong changes. Slavery for millennia was commonplace and not seen as wrong. Heck, Africans sold their own people into slavery. So in both of these senses, morality can be seen as subjective. 


Yet despite the opinions of the past, slavery is wrong. This is a fact. Mental gymnastics and culture was what tricked people into thinking it was OK. So in that sense there is an objective morality. Just because people don't agree or change opinions doesn't mean that truth does not exist. 


But then on the subjective side, there are very hard moral choices sometimes. Use a classic example, killing Hitler before he became a dictator. Is it wrong because it's murder or right because it saves lives? I'm such a case and in less extreme cases, there may not be an answer and it is up to the individual to decide their course of action, in other words, it is subjective. This may not make sense at first, but consider another dilemma. You have extra money to spend and can't decide whether you want to donate it to charity or buy your girlfriend a present. Is there really a wrong answer here? Would it be morally wrong to spend the money on yourself even? No. Therefore not all choices are as black and white as right and wrong. Even in the Hitler example, there is no wrong choice because we simply don't have enough information. Would killing him cause an alternate future that is  even worse? Would killing him solve every modern problem we have? There is no way to know without being an advanced time traveler or God. Therefore it is subjective to the individual to choose what seems best to them. 


However, if you chose to kill or not kill because you wanted to mess things up as much as possible, that WOULD be wrong. Sometimes our attitude is more important than the action itself. However, if you are unaware at age 42 that drinking in driving is illegal and all around bad idea and you drive drunk and kill someone, you should not be exempt from responsibility simply because you are an idiot. So in that sense morality is objective. 


So basically morality is complex, though it is spun to be more complex than it is, I agree with you. It is generally easy to determine whether something is right, wrong, or neutral. I have found many controversial topics to be controversial not for their complexity but because people are selfish and try to make it complex so they are justified. That said, some things truly are complex. ",r1,0.3,0.5,0.6,0.5,0.4,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.2,0.7,0.4,0.5,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.8,0.3,0.5,r2,,
"The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to tease out meaning. Many other amendments overlap in meaning and could be combined to simplify them while also covering more people. The fact is, it is outdated.

I believe it should be revised every 100 years or so because culture and language are organic. They change based on technology, public conscious, and international relations. Should we follow the advice of a group who believed slavery was acceptable? That thought only white, male, property owners should/could vote? Can you read through the document and understand what was meant or does much of it come across as confusing to todays readers? The world has changed and I believe we need to change with it in order to be relevant. I also believe our ideas and views from today will experience the same degradation over time. In 100 years will the world still care about gun rights? Will the population still speak mostly english or will we add more spanish to our vocabulary? Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had? We cannot know. We should not force our ideas through time, expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers.

What I can't understand is why we are clinging to the past, to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today. We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs. We should update, revise, and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are. I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either. I am saying we should interpret it for today, update it, and use our revised version instead. Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed. It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws. It would take a lot of work, a lot would change, but I believe we would be better for it. CMV

---Edit---
Many responses seem to think I am saying scrap the whole thing and start over. No, I am saying we need an updated, reworded one that uses the meanings as we take them today. All men are equal shoule read all persons, prohibition and its repeal should just be removed, the 15th and 19th should be combined and all inclusive with restrictions put in after the fact. Those are examples of what I mean but not the whole of it.

To CMV you need to show me that having an old, poorly worded document is better than a revision of it in modern terms. It would be hard to do but it would be better for the nation and easier to work with than if we left it be. CMV

"If this is a duplicate post, I apologize, an AutoMod told my my old version was too short and that it was removed.

Here's my logic, though:

If I get drunk and blow off all my money, it's my problem.

If I get drunk and crash my car, it's my problem.

If I get drunk and get into a fight, it's my problem.

If I get drunk and have sex, it's my problem.

-----------------------

Of course, though, if you slip something into my drink and have sex with me, that's not my fault, and if you give me a drink and say it's Mountain Dew when it is actually something that knocks me out, it's your fault.

So if it wasn't concious and consentual, then it's still rape.

And if you were given it under a false idea of what you were ingesting, it's arguably still rape. (But if you say, oh sir I didn't know that alcohol makes you make bad decisions it's not rape)

------------------------------

worknman brought up something I didn't think to address, but I meant if someone says ""yes"" and has something in their body that they put in themselves that they knew makes them make bad decision, it's not rape. A drunk person *can* give consent if they consentually got drunk.

So also, if someone attempts to have sex with them and they say ""no"" and are too drunk to fight back, it's still rape, because they didn't give consent.

I'm probably gonna get lynched for asking this, but it's basic courtesy. Please don't downvote everything I say just because you disagree, please. It's very obviously going to happen, but please, just don't.

"I have hypothyroidism, PCOS, and used to be a emotional binge eater. I lost over 60lbs. I understand that conditions can limit someones ability to easily lose weight, but considering I have 2 physical ones and 1 mental one, and still lost weight. I just don't understand.

I'm starting to look at fat loss as simply a matter of accepting that your diet is flawed and making changes. People have false views of how healthy they eat and this pride prevents them from making changes they need. 

Everytime I post something like this I just get a million downvotes. Why do people downvote me? Is it because I'm wrong somehow and millions of people truly can't lose weight.

Edit: Okay it makes more sense. ""Simply"" being a troubled word that implies weight loss is easy. That was incorrect.

 I was obese as a child and lost the weight when I grew old enough to buy and prepare my own food. I'm blessed with a preference for the healthy food and slowly taught myself to lower my appetite, making my experience easier than most. I shouldn't project myself so much on other people.

No one is arguing thermodynamics or saying weight loss is impossible. Everyone is saying that it is hard and after varies arguments I'm inclined to agree.

However, while weight loss is hard due to various factors, they do have solutions. ex: An emotional eater can indivually work out their food addiction. While it isn't easy, it can be done. I can't settle for ""can't"". I feel like that is too dismissive and hopeless. 

But it is a matter of willpower. The debate is whether people can control their willpower. It is also a matter of wanting to lose weight. Settling for being overweight is a choice a lot of people seem to make. But I guess its sort of the same thing as smoking. Something in theory can be fixed by putting down the cigarette but a ton of inner strife.

But in all seriousness, for all people who do want to loose weight. How can I help them (I forgot to mention I'm a nutrition student) loose weight by dealing with psychological factors. Nutrition actually has little classes on psychology and weight loss, and mostly cooking and science classes. I sorta rely on reddit to educate myself.

How can weight loss become easier? What can I do? What can society do? Etc

Also, I'm kinda hung up on few things. I feel like while people may not want to, pretty much every condition can be overcome. With the exception of people with extremely low BMRs where the subsequent nutrient defences and hunger pangs outweigh the benefits of wright loss.

So I guess my view has been partially changed. So like ""half deltas all around"". When I figure out how to give a delta I will award particularly thought provoking comments. 

Edit 2: oh I forgot to mention I never ever condone bullying or shaming fat people. The never directly tell people they should lose weight. From when I was fat ""my mirror tells me I'm fat everyday, I don't need to hear it from anyone else""

I mean, first off:

&gt; I understand that conditions can limit someones ability to easily lose weight, but considering I have 2 physical ones and 1 mental one, and still lost weight. I just don't understand.

Not everyone has the same condition you did. This is basically saying ""If I could do it, anyone could!"" ...which is rarely true.

&gt; The debate is whether people can control their willpower.

If this is the debate, then I think science has shown pretty conclusively by now that people have very little control or insight over their own minds. There are entire industries built around this premise.

It turns out that most of human reasoning is unconscious, that we make decisions *before* we're consciously aware that we've made them. This is pretty well established, scientifically -- if you wire a person up properly, you can actually tell exactly what decision they're going to make before *they* know what they'll decide. Your ""reasons"" for making the decision are often after-the-fact *rationalizations.*

This is why advertising works so well. *Rarely,* you can actually make a perfectly rational decision. Most of the time, you don't have enough information to actually know which brand of toothpaste is the best value for the money -- and even if you did, the amount of mental effort it would take is worth less to you than the amount of money you'd save. It's not even that -- you won't ever do that calculation, you'll instead just *subconsciously* give up on the rational approach and just pick something.

At which point, the [mere-exposure effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect) means you'll probably pick something you've heard of, like Colgate. Then, maybe you'll say it was because you like the Enhanced Whitening or whatever bullshit is on the box, because you like to think of yourself as rational. And, here's the key, *you'll do all that without realizing it.* You won't remember that you've seen a Colgate ad, you certainly won't realize you're buying it because of a Colgate ad, but you are.

That's you, that's me, that's pretty much all of humanity, except when we're putting a ton of conscious mental effort into thinking rationally.

And that's a decision you make because of a subtle message you've heard a few times on TV or something. Put the same lazy, irrational brain up against a basic biological impulse, like hunger or sex or even a craving for sugar, and it becomes *much* more difficult.

That is why dieting fails. Just telling people to eat fewer calories is about as effective as abstinence-only sex education. Abstinence-only education doesn't fail because abstinence doesn't work, it fails because **people don't abstain.** The science is also settled on this one -- abstinence-only sex education *universally* leads to higher pregnancy rates than proper sex education. And, similarly, the science is pretty settled on diets -- the act of ""going on a diet"" almost never actually makes a difference in the long term, because people fall off their diets and gain back all that weight and more.

So no, people don't have control over their willpower, at least not enough to make a change like this stick through willpower alone.

&gt; But in all seriousness, for all people who do want to loose weight. How can I help them (I forgot to mention I'm a nutrition student) loose weight by dealing with psychological factors.

First, don't take my word for the above. Take a psychology course or two. Read [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555). You're a student, go study. I'm sure as hell not a primary source, and if this is going to be your job, I really hope you get better at it than I am.

My advice to people wanting to lose weight would be: Instead of picking diets by how catchy their marketing is or how strong the science is, pick a diet on this basis alone: How likely are you to be able to stick to this diet for the rest of your life? Same for an exercise program -- and do both of those things.

For example, [I like this](http://www.nosdiet.com/). I know you've taken some flack for the word ""simple"", but simplicity is a big part of this -- it has to be *really, stupidly, painfully obvious* that you're cheating, otherwise you'll say things like ""It's okay to have this donut, because I went jogging this morning."" To make it even easier, if you find yourself thinking that, you don't have to deny yourself donuts, just hold off till Saturday and have a donut then.

I'd start with something like that to reduce the *amount* they're eating, and then, as a secondary concern, make some suggestions for healthy stuff they could be eating instead.

&gt; What can society do?

A hell of a lot more.

For example, I used to think that [these restrictions were stupid](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2910). But it actually makes a ton of sense -- if I get a small container of sugary drink, I'll still probably only get one container. And we still tend to drink the entire container of whatever and then stop, unless we really are that thirsty (which is almost never) -- so I'll probably drink that one container and then stop.

It's nanny-state-ish and infantilizing, but I'll bet it works. I'm really curious what the results will be.

Another example, this time about smoking: When you require [this kind of labeling](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/Australia_Cigarettes_Packaging.jpg), people really do smoke less. I'm not sure how you'd decide what sorts of food you should put a picture of Fat Bastard on, but I'll bet if you did that, people would eat less of them. These are visceral, gut reactions *in the moment.* The sort of thing that will punch through to that subconscious lizard brain that was about to buy you a pack of cigarettes (or a Big Mac), and at the very least wake up your conscious brain and give you a fighting chance.","It is true that any person will lose weight if diet and exercise are properly adjusted. The important part of your question is whether any person can actually make the adjustments to diet and exercise to produce (and sustain) weight loss.

People are not robots. We are subject to forces of emotion, motivation, willpower, bias, and so on.

That which seems objectively simple to accomplish in isolation can be exceedingly difficult in practice. I believe that everyone can directly observe this to be true with a moment's reflection on their own shortcomings and struggles.

* ""I'm not going to procrastinate anymore.""
* ""I won't yell at him anymore.""
* ""I'm going to go running every day.""
* ""I'll never again drink until I throw up.""
* ""I'm going to stop spending so much money.""
* ""I won't let sports make me this angry again.""
* ""It's irrational for me to be so jealous.""
* ""Why should I care if I'm not invited to some party?""

Pain, sadness, boredom, loneliness, routine, socially embedded temptation, fatigue, stress, cognitive biases, competing demands, family crisis, fear, money issues, disease, social learning, etc. -- all of these are capable of derailing sincere efforts at personal change.

If there anything in your life you have decided to change and yet have not been able to change, then this argument should ring true.

A person has become fat because they are not good at regulating diet and exercise for whatever reason (biological, psychological, social-cultural, environmental/circumstantial, etc.). Almost by definition, these are people who struggle to adjust diet and exercise. It is therefore like saying ""Any depressed person can be happier by simply adjusting their thoughts and feelings"" or ""Any anxious person ... by caring less about the future"" or ""Sex addict ... by choosing not to engage in sexual acts"" or ""debtor ... by earning more and spending less"" or ""smoker .. by not smoking."" These are true but useless statements, because the person in question practically lacks the abilities required given their current set of circumstances. Advice for all of these kinds of problems centers on how to change psychology or circumstances rather than on the simple idea of the end goal (eat less, smoke less, yell less).

That is why there are books and communities and medicines and science and billions of dollars centered on these kinds of personal change efforts. What's required is a change in the environment/circumstances or in the psychology - and that's not easy to do at all.

Let me flip this around. Can you imagine a scenario where a person cannot successfully accomplish the needed adjustment to diet and exercise?

Go over to a place like /r/progresspics and read comments on how people were able to accomplish their transformation. Generally, you'll hear about some fairly specific  set of factors that helped them start and then persist in their journey. New ideas, supportive friends, emotional growth, frightening experiences, a definite system, a change in life situation, regular efforts to stay motivated, and so on.

Now while reading something like that, start mentally deleting the factors that they are crediting. ""I couldn't have done it without the help of my wife"" - take away the wife. ""I found boxing and that was what clicked after years of nothing clicking"" - boxing was never a sport. ""I finally decided to prioritize my self and take care of myself"" - they were struggling to make it day to day due to environmental stressors (small kids, money problems, work stress, emotionally abusive person in life) and couldn't focus on personal growth. ""The doctor said I would die before I was 50"" - the complications of overweight not being as present for them and the doc never delivering that warning.

Then, there's the reality that most of us are flawed or face challenge in many ways at once. It's not just being overweight - it's being overweight and poor. It's not just being fat - it's being fat and depressed. Fat and short-tempered. Fat and failing some classes. Fat and an emotionally absent father. Fat and financially irresponsible. Overweight and socially anxious.  And generally the list is much longer than just two problems. Many people who want to be better people are pouring a lot of energy into working on something other than being overweight, and it leaves little for the other problem.  Conversely, many who successfully lose a lot of weight do so by streamlining and focusing their attention on that specific problem at the expense of other things they could have focused on instead.

All this to say, personal change requires work, and some forms of personal change require so much work as to be practically impossible given the resources and energy available to accomplish that work. That's why successful weight loss often requires much much more than just the idea of eating less and exercising more. And until the person finds that other thing that is required for their situational factors to shift enough to change the behavior, they are unlikely to be successful in adjusting diet and exercise over the long run.

**EDIT**: I want to add something to speak to the other side of the coin because some comments have rightly pointed out that this may come across as fatalistic. I'm a big proponent of personal responsibility and personal growth. 

If you have something in your life causing problems or holding you back, I would encourage you to look for solutions and - if it's important enough of a thing - to not give up. I have worked with a lot of people with mental health issues, for example, who say, ""I can't"" to things that they absolutely are capable of doing and do go on to do. An attitude of pessimism is often a self-fulfilling prophecy and certainly limits the chances we have to get lucky with the solution to the puzzle or simply to break through due to persistence. The synthesis of my views would be this: we are shaped by many forces but are also capable of ingenuity, resiliency, and change. If you attempt something critically important and fail, either try again, try a new approach, or try something else.

Change is not as simple as 'eat less' because behavior is largely the product of a network of causal factors. And for the exact same reason, change is also rarely impossible - there are many factors that can be tweaked up and down the causal chain, though it can take A LOT of effort and probably resources and external support as well. The right small shift can alter the overall set of circumstances and tip the outcome in another direction. And sometimes, it's something as simple as time or trying again.",37,"You make some good points, but I don't think your blanket conclusion holds. I mean, first off:

&gt; I understand that conditions can limit someones ability to easily lose weight, but considering I have 2 physical ones and 1 mental one, and still lost weight. I just don't understand.

Not everyone has the same condition you did. This is basically saying ""If I could do it, anyone could!"" ...which is rarely true.

&gt; The debate is whether people can control their willpower.

If this is the debate, then I think science has shown pretty conclusively by now that people have very little control or insight over their own minds. There are entire industries built around this premise.

It turns out that most of human reasoning is unconscious, that we make decisions *before* we're consciously aware that we've made them. This is pretty well established, scientifically -- if you wire a person up properly, you can actually tell exactly what decision they're going to make before *they* know what they'll decide. Your ""reasons"" for making the decision are often after-the-fact *rationalizations.*

This is why advertising works so well. *Rarely,* you can actually make a perfectly rational decision. Most of the time, you don't have enough information to actually know which brand of toothpaste is the best value for the money -- and even if you did, the amount of mental effort it would take is worth less to you than the amount of money you'd save. It's not even that -- you won't ever do that calculation, you'll instead just *subconsciously* give up on the rational approach and just pick something.

At which point, the [mere-exposure effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect) means you'll probably pick something you've heard of, like Colgate. Then, maybe you'll say it was because you like the Enhanced Whitening or whatever bullshit is on the box, because you like to think of yourself as rational. And, here's the key, *you'll do all that without realizing it.* You won't remember that you've seen a Colgate ad, you certainly won't realize you're buying it because of a Colgate ad, but you are.

That's you, that's me, that's pretty much all of humanity, except when we're putting a ton of conscious mental effort into thinking rationally.

And that's a decision you make because of a subtle message you've heard a few times on TV or something. Put the same lazy, irrational brain up against a basic biological impulse, like hunger or sex or even a craving for sugar, and it becomes *much* more difficult.

That is why dieting fails. Just telling people to eat fewer calories is about as effective as abstinence-only sex education. Abstinence-only education doesn't fail because abstinence doesn't work, it fails because **people don't abstain.** The science is also settled on this one -- abstinence-only sex education *universally* leads to higher pregnancy rates than proper sex education. And, similarly, the science is pretty settled on diets -- the act of ""going on a diet"" almost never actually makes a difference in the long term, because people fall off their diets and gain back all that weight and more.

So no, people don't have control over their willpower, at least not enough to make a change like this stick through willpower alone.

&gt; But in all seriousness, for all people who do want to loose weight. How can I help them (I forgot to mention I'm a nutrition student) loose weight by dealing with psychological factors.

First, don't take my word for the above. Take a psychology course or two. Read [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555). You're a student, go study. I'm sure as hell not a primary source, and if this is going to be your job, I really hope you get better at it than I am.

My advice to people wanting to lose weight would be: Instead of picking diets by how catchy their marketing is or how strong the science is, pick a diet on this basis alone: How likely are you to be able to stick to this diet for the rest of your life? Same for an exercise program -- and do both of those things.

For example, [I like this](http://www.nosdiet.com/). I know you've taken some flack for the word ""simple"", but simplicity is a big part of this -- it has to be *really, stupidly, painfully obvious* that you're cheating, otherwise you'll say things like ""It's okay to have this donut, because I went jogging this morning."" To make it even easier, if you find yourself thinking that, you don't have to deny yourself donuts, just hold off till Saturday and have a donut then.

I'd start with something like that to reduce the *amount* they're eating, and then, as a secondary concern, make some suggestions for healthy stuff they could be eating instead.

&gt; What can society do?

A hell of a lot more.

For example, I used to think that [these restrictions were stupid](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2910). But it actually makes a ton of sense -- if I get a small container of sugary drink, I'll still probably only get one container. And we still tend to drink the entire container of whatever and then stop, unless we really are that thirsty (which is almost never) -- so I'll probably drink that one container and then stop.

It's nanny-state-ish and infantilizing, but I'll bet it works. I'm really curious what the results will be.

Another example, this time about smoking: When you require [this kind of labeling](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/Australia_Cigarettes_Packaging.jpg), people really do smoke less. I'm not sure how you'd decide what sorts of food you should put a picture of Fat Bastard on, but I'll bet if you did that, people would eat less of them. These are visceral, gut reactions *in the moment.* The sort of thing that will punch through to that subconscious lizard brain that was about to buy you a pack of cigarettes (or a Big Mac), and at the very least wake up your conscious brain and give you a fighting chance.","It is true that any person will lose weight if diet and exercise are properly adjusted. The important part of your question is whether any person can actually make the adjustments to diet and exercise to produce (and sustain) weight loss.

People are not robots. We are subject to forces of emotion, motivation, willpower, bias, and so on.

That which seems objectively simple to accomplish in isolation can be exceedingly difficult in practice. I believe that everyone can directly observe this to be true with a moment's reflection on their own shortcomings and struggles.

* ""I'm not going to procrastinate anymore.""
* ""I won't yell at him anymore.""
* ""I'm going to go running every day.""
* ""I'll never again drink until I throw up.""
* ""I'm going to stop spending so much money.""
* ""I won't let sports make me this angry again.""
* ""It's irrational for me to be so jealous.""
* ""Why should I care if I'm not invited to some party?""

Pain, sadness, boredom, loneliness, routine, socially embedded temptation, fatigue, stress, cognitive biases, competing demands, family crisis, fear, money issues, disease, social learning, etc. -- all of these are capable of derailing sincere efforts at personal change.

If there anything in your life you have decided to change and yet have not been able to change, then this argument should ring true.

A person has become fat because they are not good at regulating diet and exercise for whatever reason (biological, psychological, social-cultural, environmental/circumstantial, etc.). Almost by definition, these are people who struggle to adjust diet and exercise. It is therefore like saying ""Any depressed person can be happier by simply adjusting their thoughts and feelings"" or ""Any anxious person ... by caring less about the future"" or ""Sex addict ... by choosing not to engage in sexual acts"" or ""debtor ... by earning more and spending less"" or ""smoker .. by not smoking."" These are true but useless statements, because the person in question practically lacks the abilities required given their current set of circumstances. Advice for all of these kinds of problems centers on how to change psychology or circumstances rather than on the simple idea of the end goal (eat less, smoke less, yell less).

That is why there are books and communities and medicines and science and billions of dollars centered on these kinds of personal change efforts. What's required is a change in the environment/circumstances or in the psychology - and that's not easy to do at all.

Let me flip this around. Can you imagine a scenario where a person cannot successfully accomplish the needed adjustment to diet and exercise?

Go over to a place like /r/progresspics and read comments on how people were able to accomplish their transformation. Generally, you'll hear about some fairly specific  set of factors that helped them start and then persist in their journey. New ideas, supportive friends, emotional growth, frightening experiences, a definite system, a change in life situation, regular efforts to stay motivated, and so on.

Now while reading something like that, start mentally deleting the factors that they are crediting. ""I couldn't have done it without the help of my wife"" - take away the wife. ""I found boxing and that was what clicked after years of nothing clicking"" - boxing was never a sport. ""I finally decided to prioritize my self and take care of myself"" - they were struggling to make it day to day due to environmental stressors (small kids, money problems, work stress, emotionally abusive person in life) and couldn't focus on personal growth. ""The doctor said I would die before I was 50"" - the complications of overweight not being as present for them and the doc never delivering that warning.

Then, there's the reality that most of us are flawed or face challenge in many ways at once. It's not just being overweight - it's being overweight and poor. It's not just being fat - it's being fat and depressed. Fat and short-tempered. Fat and failing some classes. Fat and an emotionally absent father. Fat and financially irresponsible. Overweight and socially anxious.  And generally the list is much longer than just two problems. Many people who want to be better people are pouring a lot of energy into working on something other than being overweight, and it leaves little for the other problem.  Conversely, many who successfully lose a lot of weight do so by streamlining and focusing their attention on that specific problem at the expense of other things they could have focused on instead.

All this to say, personal change requires work, and some forms of personal change require so much work as to be practically impossible given the resources and energy available to accomplish that work. That's why successful weight loss often requires much much more than just the idea of eating less and exercising more. And until the person finds that other thing that is required for their situational factors to shift enough to change the behavior, they are unlikely to be successful in adjusting diet and exercise over the long run.

"It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing which I believe is important and not many people are talking about is *cultural influence*. I'm not talking about GDP or lobbying power, I'm talking about blue jeans, pop music, the idea of social mobility, emancipation and suffrage for all. These are all concepts born in the West and exported all around the world, causing social changes in the cultures of the countries they take root in. More and more young Japanese are breaking off from their country's own traditions to follow Western culture, before their radicalization (also, unfortunately, facilitated by the West) blue jeans and pop music was taking the Middle East by storm, African nouveau riche seek to emulate the Western businessman lifestyle ideal of sleek cars and fat cigars. The whole *idea* of the Western way of life has bled into the cultures of countries all over the world, and has likely changed them almost irrevocably.

However, I cannot see that the same thing has happened with regards to China. The biggest cultural exporter in the East as far as I can see is Japan, despite its smaller economy and shrinking population: people still can't get enough of Manga and anime, of Japanese fashion (the trendier edge of which is mainly a Japanese take on Western fashion), of Japanese cuisine, of the whole idea of the Japanese society as one of politeness and civility in any situation. Heck, even Japanese bands are some of the most globally popular Eastern bands (though South Korea might take the crown with regards to this one after PSY).

The point I'm making is that apart from cuisine, I cannot see of any real cultural impact Chinese culture has had on the rest of the world, especially when compared to the influences of Western culture as well as Korean and Japanese culture. Because of this, I find it hard to take China seriously as a social threat, although politically and economically I accept that they are strong.","Every major city in America has a Chinatown in it, many Americans get Chinese characters tattooed on themselves, Chinese martial arts movies are pretty popular and have won awards in American organizations (like Crouching tiger hidden dragon), Jacky Chan and Bruce Lee among others are household names, martial arts in general, Chinese influenced Budhism and Taoism(Zen), mainstream tv shows like *Fresh off the Boat* are evident of the growing influence, [Chinese as a foreign language is becoming a more prevalent choice]( http://www.denverpost.com/ci_21825189/mandarin-chinese-becoming-first-choice-second-language), [China is growing as a tourist destination]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_China) strengthening its influnce abroad, as its economy grows you'll see more cars, electronics, and other household goods (you'd be surprised how many household goods are already designed and manufactured in China), Chinese cuisine is ubiquitous in American cities, and bigger and bigger contributions in science that will affect us all.","Even if we take your idea as 100% accurate, that china has zero cultural influence, all you need to do is look at the de facto impact that they (and to a lesser extent, Vietnam, Cambodia, and bengladesh) have already had.

"I recently discovered /r/Anglish.  Anglish is an attempt to construct a version of English using only Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic roots.  The result is a language that not only sounds beautiful, but is much more intuitive to learn new vocabulary.

Take, for example, this [list of lores](http://anglish.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Lores).  Rather than using Greek-derived names for the sciences, which are completely meaningless to the average learner of English until they learn the name of that particular science, Anglish uses simple compounds from common, everyday words that language learners would already be familiar with.  Many languages do this as well.

The result of incorporating all these foreign words is that English no consistency of grammar, spelling, pronunciation, or anything.  This makes it more confusing and burdensome to learn.

I should specify that I'm speaking of a regulator with the goal of keeping English clear, consistent, and true to its roots.  Obviously, a language regulator that pushed for the inclusion of these foreign words would be no help.

It may be too late now, given the use of English as an international language, but I think it is a shame and a detriment to international communication that English wasn't standardized this way a long time ago.

French, as you pointed out, has a language regulator with the power to decide what is and is not proper French. There are roughly 77 million native French speakers in the world. By comparison, English, which has no such authoritative regulator, has about 400 million speakers. It is the language of [business](https://hbr.org/2012/05/global-business-speaks-english), the [language](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29543708) of [science](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/01/english_is_the_language_of_science_u_s_dominance_means_other_scientists.html), even the language of international [air travel](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/761307/English-to-become-compulsory-for-pilots.html). It is overall seen as the [dominant](http://www.cepr.org/PRESS/DP2055PR.htm) international language today: where a Belgian and an Argentinian may not speak each other's native language, there is a reasonable chance they both speak English, and so has a great deal of utility. At best, French is maintained as the language of [diplomacy](http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/languages-diplomacy) but even that is starting to be supplanted by [English](http://www.legallanguage.com/legal-articles/language-of-diplomacy/), which makes sense considering that more people know English by many, many degrees. Ironically enough, French is no longer the lingua franca in much of the world. 

Why is this? Partially, it can be explained by the political dominance of, first, the British Empire and, immediately after, the American Empire. But another reason is that, contrary to your assertion, its willingness to absorb the words of other languages makes it easier to pick up and use by non-native speakers. French, and other linguistically purist cultures, take a protectionist approach to their language, carefully pruning it to make sure it grows only in the way they want it to grow. By contrast, English takes a more free market approach, where words can easily cross borders and be changed to suit the needs of whomever uses them--if French is a carefully pruned topiary, English is an all-devouring kudzu vine. While a topiary certainly looks better, and may be less bothersome, none can argue that it grows faster, and requires less maintenance, than kudzu. This, in fact, is criticized as [linguistic imperialism. ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_imperialism) Whether or not one agrees that the spread of English is a good thing, none can deny that this is indeed happening on a mass scale. 

This makes intuitive sense: a language that can be easily adapted and modified and changed will spread more quickly than a language that cannot, because ultimately languages are utilitarian creatures. People learn them to use them, and if a language is more difficult to use, then it will be more difficult (and less appealing) to learn. English readily accepts loan words. French, official ""proper"" French (not speaking of colloquial French here), does not. English is simply a more hospitable environment for foreign words, and this has in turn made English more attractive. If we think of it in terms of nations, all other things being equal, which country will have more immigrants: one with an open door policy and a speedy path to citizenship, or one with a highly restrictive immigration policy with an exhaustive and lengthy path to citizenship? 

So, contrary to your view, English's lack of regulation has actually made it *easier* to learn, not harder. The trouble people have when learning English usually has to do mainly with the grammar structure than the vocabulary. This is a good problem to have, because a vocabulary mistake can be easily corrected, while a grammatical mistake (we're talking big ones, like wrong word order, versus ending sentences with prepositions) cripples understanding. Further, while this is highly subjective (but then again, so is your point), I believe that English's willingness to change and adopt foreign words as its own (and adopt and change foreign words too) makes it very beautiful. There are concepts that simply cannot be expressed with English words on hand, and so it's quite useful to be able to simply take another word to fill in the gap, and so thereby increase the language's range of expression. If we were only restricted to Anglo-Saxon derived words, the things we could communicate would, I believe, contract significantly. 

Upon further thought, I also find it odd you would single out English for having inconsistencies in grammar, spelling, pronunciation and more--every language has weird things about it that can confound even native speakers. This even includes French. Much of this inconsistency comes from colloquial usage and geographic diversity. Sure, it's weird that some people insist on calling ""soda"" ""pop"" instead, but I don't think the country needs to settle on one definitive word to use for ""sugary, fizzy beverage."" 

Ultimately, to trap the English language in amber like some Jurassic-era mosquito is to remove the vitality, dynamism, adaptability and diversity that makes it such a strong language in the first place. This does mean, of course, that the English of today won't be the English of 100 years from now, just as it's not the English of 100 years ago, but that's a feature, not a bug. A language that cannot, will not, adapt will find itself to be like a highly specialized organism that does extremely well for its niche but is unable to adjust to changing circumstance--and those organisms tend to go extinct much faster.

At best, French is maintained as the language of [diplomacy](http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/languages-diplomacy) but even that is starting to be supplanted by [English](http://www.legallanguage.com/legal-articles/language-of-diplomacy/), which makes sense considering that more people know English by many, many degrees. Ironically enough, French is no longer the lingua franca in much of the world. 

Why is this? Partially, it can be explained by the political dominance of, first, the British Empire and, immediately after, the American Empire. But another reason is that, contrary to your assertion, its willingness to absorb the words of other languages makes it easier to pick up and use by non-native speakers. French, and other linguistically purist cultures, take a protectionist approach to their language, carefully pruning it to make sure it grows only in the way they want it to grow. By contrast, English takes a more free market approach, where words can easily cross borders and be changed to suit the needs of whomever uses them--if French is a carefully pruned topiary, English is an all-devouring kudzu vine. While a topiary certainly looks better, and may be less bothersome, none can argue that it grows faster, and requires less maintenance, than kudzu. This, in fact, is criticized as [linguistic imperialism. ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_imperialism) Whether or not one agrees that the spread of English is a good thing, none can deny that this is indeed happening on a mass scale. 

This makes intuitive sense: a language that can be easily adapted and modified and changed will spread more quickly than a language that cannot, because ultimately languages are utilitarian creatures. People learn them to use them, and if a language is more difficult to use, then it will be more difficult (and less appealing) to learn. English readily accepts loan words. French, official ""proper"" French (not speaking of colloquial French here), does not. English is simply a more hospitable environment for foreign words, and this has in turn made English more attractive. If we think of it in terms of nations, all other things being equal, which country will have more immigrants: one with an open door policy and a speedy path to citizenship, or one with a highly restrictive immigration policy with an exhaustive and lengthy path to citizenship? 

So, contrary to your view, English's lack of regulation has actually made it *easier* to learn, not harder. The trouble people have when learning English usually has to do mainly with the grammar structure than the vocabulary. This is a good problem to have, because a vocabulary mistake can be easily corrected, while a grammatical mistake (we're talking big ones, like wrong word order, versus ending sentences with prepositions) cripples understanding. Further, while this is highly subjective (but then again, so is your point), I believe that English's willingness to change and adopt foreign words as its own (and adopt and change foreign words too) makes it very beautiful. There are concepts that simply cannot be expressed with English words on hand, and so it's quite useful to be able to simply take another word to fill in the gap, and so thereby increase the language's range of expression. If we were only restricted to Anglo-Saxon derived words, the things we could communicate would, I believe, contract significantly. 

Upon further thought, I also find it odd you would single out English for having inconsistencies in grammar, spelling, pronunciation and more--every language has weird things about it that can confound even native speakers. This even includes French. Much of this inconsistency comes from colloquial usage and geographic diversity. Sure, it's weird that some people insist on calling ""soda"" ""pop"" instead, but I don't think the country needs to settle on one definitive word to use for ""sugary, fizzy beverage."" 

Ultimately, to trap the English language in amber like some Jurassic-era mosquito is to remove the vitality, dynamism, adaptability and diversity that makes it such a strong language in the first place. This does mean, of course, that the English of today won't be the English of 100 years from now, just as it's not the English of 100 years ago, but that's a feature, not a bug. A language that cannot, will not, adapt will find itself to be like a highly specialized organism that does extremely well for its niche but is unable to adjust to changing circumstance--and those organisms tend to go extinct much faster.

"Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich. However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons:

First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”. Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people’s inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. 

Second of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds. Examples for this are Venezuela or Columbia. 

All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc. However this are minor elements, which I think, should otherwise be implemented in fierce Capitalist society, where in order to succeed you cannot rely on gov. support, but 95 % on yourself.

Edit: I hope this is not too long of an explanation.

From all the socialist books I've read, (and I don't know if you've read any), it is never required theoretically that people should become perfect. Instead, socialism as a theory is conceptualised as one which will more perfectly fit human nature as it is. 

Firstly, what is human nature? The first thing we can say about it is that it is very varied. It is just whatever humans do. But humans do a lot of things. 

The central mistake that proponents of the argument from human nature make is a kind of ""begging the question"". They assume that human behaviour in a capitalist system must be the paradigm of human behaviour per se. I think this is demonstrably false, as a moment's reflection will show. 

For the vast majority of time that humans have existed, they were hunter-gatherers, living in fairly small communities or tribes and practising some form or other of primitive communism, ie, sharing the spoils of the hunt. Social structures were also more or less egalitarian, necessarily, because of required co-operation in the hunt. 

If mankind has a species character, it will be informed by being a hunter-gatherer, living in a social group. Other social forms, cities, states, capitalism, consumerism, and so on, are much later, much more recent developments. 

So what we can take from this about human nature? 1. Humans are a social species, they can collaborate and join their labour together for the common good. 2, Humans are creative, and find meaning and dignity in creativity. And you can also, more tentatively, add: 3. Humans are at their best when free to contract the kinds of social relationships and pursue the creative activities they want.

Well this exactly accords with the species character of man described by Marx and, before him, by the philosophers of the Enlightenment. Man is given naturally to free, cooperative, creative labour. 

Now comes the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution transformed the farm worker into a factory worker, a proletariat. Labour became *necessarily* collaborative again. 

Socialism is nothing more, at a basic level, than a theoretical response to these facts about human nature and human creativity, and the facts of limited global resources and labour. If you want to, you can look at it merely as a rational, efficient use of resources and labour, getting rid of unproductive classes, middlemen, profiteers, production of useless commodities, and so on. 

So to sum up, your ""argument from human nature"" is, as usual when this argument is brought up, based on the usual question-begging and is, I'm sorry to say, based on something of a strawman socialism. I recommend that you read up on the topic and you'll see that no serious socialist writer demands or expects perfectibility. 

Your other objection, that socialism, in order to function properly, would require a world-wide system, is more serious and has more force to it.  But that was only ever a long-term goal and it doesn't follow that we can't try to achieve change in our day-to-day lives, and in our own local polities. After all, world-wide changes have been affected before and they will be again. 

I would also briefly say that very few people advocate a Soviet-style system these days. No-one is anxious to recreate the days of Stalin and gulags and show trials. But once you grasp that that was a deviation from the course of socialism proper, (and was recognised as such at the time by perceptive critics), the goals of socialism in the present day become all the more clear. ","&gt; then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers 

This why the  phrase ""Workers of the World, Unite!"" exists.

Ultimately, the biggest thing that can be done is to unite the working class. Join unions, negotiate better pay and working conditions for everyone the world over.

Obviously this is better achieved at a country level - but it can be expanded worldwide by those who are doing something in their own country, to (for example) only purchase or conduct businesses with other companies in other countries who are also improving the rights of their workers. Ultimately, everyone should be paid well for reasonable hours *regardless* of their job. And by ""well"" I mean a lot more than lowest earners are currently getting, by ""well"" I mean a wage that allows people to *live* and not work for little return.

This is achievable, and will have a real impact on the entirety of humanity. It will change the economy from that of an exploitative one, to one that promotes good pay for all, and allow us to live our lives, follow our dreams, and work in careers we wish to, instead of being wage slave until we die.

Right now there is a strike on the underground system in London. Instead of people supporting them in improving their work life, and using this as inspiration to improve *their* own work conditions and pay, people are attacking them. Calling them overpaid, greedy etc (when really the people who are doing the attacking and name calling are weak and powerless as they are too afraid to do the same thing - if someone has what you don't have, you should aim to get the same, not take away from what they have. This only makes things worse for everyone, including themselves,  as then being a low paying wage slave is the norm).

"First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people is racist. However, I don't think that has any bearing on blackface today. What if an actor of another race simply wanted to portray a black character, and so they darkened the color of their skin to make their appearance more accurate? There could be absolutely no mocking of race going on, and people will still shout ""racism!""

For example, I know a white girl who tried to do an impression of Michelle Obama. She dressed up in blackface and made jokes about healthy eating and vegetables and whatnot. She got torn apart on social media for being racist. Although I can see how this impression is in bad taste, I cannot see how it is racist. She only made fun of Michelle Obama's campaigning, and she never once made fun of her race at all. And yet, it was still considered racist.","Because I surprised myself with how much I rambled here, **TL;DR:** People that color their faces to look like they belong to a different racial group might not be racists, but blackface as a symbol is racist.

To me this post is all about words, symbols, and context. I think there are so many questions raised by your post that won't fit in this comment: ""Does wearing blackface make you a racist?""; ""Don't the speaker's/actor's intentions matter before labeling them racist?""; ""Who decides what is/isn't racist?""; ""At what point does history stop controlling our modern conceptions of racism?""; ""Aren't we limiting free expression by restricting certain kinds of performance?"" Let me start by saying that I'm sorry your friend was caught up in the crap-storm that is the social media hate-echo chamber. Based on the story you told, I don't think it's fair to call her racist. I'll also say that I totally get where you're coming from. You're saying that your friend was simply trying to portray Michelle Obama who is incidentally black, and did not say or intend anything racist by it. So I'm going to take a stab at how you're thinking by walking through a question: ""Is the word 'wet back' racist?""

I think that question alone does not lend itself to an easy answer. The only reason ""wet back"" is a ""bad"" word is because we associate it with a disparaging image of undocumented Latino immigrants crossing the Rio Grande in Texas. But if I get out of the shower and forget to dry off my back, I can exclaim, ""Ah dammit I have a wet back,"" and no one bats an eye. Everyone knows that's different than *calling* someone a wet back. I'm assuming that you consider blackface as a symbol in the same light, and in a sense you're right. Words and symbols definitely have meaning, but that meaning only comes from context that we give it.

So it would obviously be way worse if your friend included references to Michelle Obama's race in her satire. But she didn't and did not intend to offend in her portrayal. So do intentions matter for context? Definitely. You know your friend better than I ever will, but I imagine that she's not a racist.

However, intention is only one part of the story. *We* give meaning to symbols, not just the person who happens to employ it. How a specific community receives a word or symbol is just as valid in considering whether or not something is racist. If I walk past a group of Mexican Americans and bemoan my crappy drying skills with the same sentence, they might mishear me and think I'm actually using the ""wet back"" slur. It might take a really careful conversation to clear the air after something like that. The relevant community sensitive to the offending word or symbol has opinions and perceptions that are valid just like the speaker's and ought to be respected. So here's the point in two parts: **1) As far as words and symbols go, context matters. 2) While intention of the speaker/performer plays a role in creating that context, so does the reception by the relevant audience/community.**

Let's take this out of language and talk about non-verbal symbols. Let's go big and talk about swastikas! Imagine that a kindergartener draws a picture at school and he unwittingly draws the Nazi swastika (as opposed to its incarnations in eastern religions). Is the teacher gonna hang that picture alongside everyone else's pictures? The teacher would probably not, and would hopefully explain that the symbol is bad and represents bad things. Why is a swastika so offensive? On a physical level, it's merely two intersecting lines with two 90 degree angles per line. But it has come to *represent* one of the most atrocious moments in human history.

Blackface is a similar symbol. The history you cited in your post is really critical for the context of blackface. As you know, blackface itself is a symbol representing much sadder and more racist times in America. If you google blackface, you will certainly find references to that burdensome history and I doubt that you'll find many neutral definitions that omit those references. I'm not black, but I imagine that this history was evoked for the relevant audience when they saw your friend. Regardless of what your friend did or said, the symbol was there and prompted the reaction. So your friend is not a racist for coloring her face to look like Michelle Obama, but blackface as a symbol is racist.

I very quickly wanted to comment your question about actors and theatrical performances that may call for a white actor coloring their face to appear black. I don't know if you've seen Tropic Thunder, but Robert Downey Jr. goes ""full blackface."" It's actually like blackface-ception. He puts on blackface to portray in the movie a white actor that surgically augments his skin color to look black for a part. If you haven't seen it, go for it. It's a funny movie, but it was not without its controversy (google ""Tropic Thunder Blackface""). Robert Downey Jr. probably isn't racist. That controversy just raises more questions that make me tired to think about (Is it ok to put on blackface to portray someone putting on blackface?).

For purposes of this comment, I think you yourself would agree that blackface the symbol is ""racist."" You concede that what your friend did was in ""bad taste."" I would agree. I would say the actions were in bad taste precisely because the symbol employed is racist. It doesn't make her a racist, and it doesn't mean that Michelle Obama is immune from satirical portrayal. It just means that anyone thinking about putting on blackface should know that they are in dangerous territory because (a) blackface is a symbol that signifies a troubled and racist history; and (b) the black community will likely react negatively to uses of the symbol because of its historical context.

Hope I changed your view!","It's considered racist because of it's history.

"Hi, I'm new.

So the greeks are complaining about the EU's imposed austerity measures, the terms of their countries increasing debt problems, even going as far as to boycott german goods and compare them to nazi's.

But they *have* been outspending their means, and are lashing out because they have gotten used to their improved quality of life under the euro and are now being threatened with having that QOL decreased.

The alternative to the imposed austerity measures is the country defaulting on its debts and becoming a failed state, and the rest of the EU is taking on a large risk by continuing to loan to a country which over the last 5 years has done nothing but ignore the demands of their creditors and complain about sanctions.

Yes, its the government's fault and not the people's, but they can't reasonably refuse cuts to their public spending that they can no longer afford, and moreover, why blame the eurozone for trying to help, and not their own incompetent government? Edit: And striking, as if their country didn't have enough problems already?!

I have a lot of objections to that sentence; let's start with the part that is objectively, factually incorrect. Greece *has* implemented the demanded austerity measures for the last couple of years (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis_countermeasures) for all the boring glory). In fact, that's a big part of the problem! Those austerity measures drove the Greek economy deeper into recession, which is largely what increased the Greek debt-to-GDP ratio (after all, when GDP goes down, debt-to-GDP goes up even when debt stays constant).

The Eurogroup position is basically that of a doctor who sees that bloodletting fails to cure the patient, and therefore prescribes even more bloodletting.

For the less factual and more political things wrong with that sentence:

&gt; defaulting on its debts and becoming a failed state

A Greek default does not mean Greece becomes a failed state - look at Argentina for a good example. Of course, if Greece had exited, the rest of the EU may have been pushed by Merkel and Schäuble to start an even more vicious and open economic war against Greece. But let's be honest here: of course a more powerful state can turn another state into a failed state out of spite or stupidity (see Afghanistan in the last 50 years for an example of the latter).

&gt; The alternative (...) is 

There are and have always been other, better alternatives. Years ago, when the first haircut on Greek debt was decided, an investment plan for Greece could have been implemented to grow the Greek economy.

"growing up in america i was condition to believe women's breast are sexual organs do to the fact that we over sexualized them too much. it wasnt till recently that i came to conscious and started realizing that there is practically no way a woman's breast could be sexual organs. i mean obviously we men have breast too and our breast dont stimulate the opposite sex in any different way. and yes i'm well aware that during sex women could receive lots of stimulation through them in the act of foreplay. but so do other body parts, like the neck, the mouth, the foot, etc. lets also not forget that women do need their breast to breastfeed  their children, which this obviously screams out that they cant be sex organs.

anyways it seems like the more i try to believe this the more negative reactions i get from those around me. people here still insist that women's breast are sexual organs and the fact that women here in america, unlike women in africa or other countries in europe are still too afraid to go topless outside when its too hot kinda punctuates this believe. we also must forget that or government does believe they are sexual breast as it is against the law either way for women to go topless out in the streets. so i was wondering if this is correct that maybe you guys can then convince me that they are sexual organs. 

I also like to point out that i was watching that documentary [Free The Nipple](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2298394/) the other day on Netflix and it really touched me. i think it really is unfair that during heatwave days a man can take his shirt off in public yet women can't. i think we americans are too damn dramatic going judgmentally ballistic when we see boobs in public. at the same do to how we americans have been sexually conditioned since day one i'm actually amazed that there are women here who complain about not being able to go topless out in public. i thought that would of been the worst and most humiliating nightmare for an American woman.



ps= speaking of legal, not that i have anything against gay people or anything but i'm actually kinda surprised that today gay marriage is legal yet it's still illegal for women to go out topless in public.

Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, and though I believe the world is not black and white and there is a grey area in between, what is that grey area? I haven't been able to figure it out like, for example: a man steals food from a shop because he doesn't have enough money and he needs to feed his kids, then he gets caught and taken to prison. Though he did something ""bad"" (stealing) for a ""good"" cause (feed his children), he still did something bad therefore he gets a punishment. Where's the grey in that? I don't know.

That's one of my confusions, the grey between the black and white. To be clear, I'm not bigoted or religious and I understand there are diferent types of good and different types of bad depending on your context, where you live.

The other thing I'm confused about and that is fairly linked to the first one is if there's something besides ""the good"" and ""the bad"". I personaly live by trying to do the good but I also think that the bad is necesary until a certain degree.

"So, I'm confused about this whole, *""appropriation of white supremacy""* and *""reverse racism""* not existing thing.

&amp;nbsp;

From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color and/or nationality. Meaning, minorities/persons of color/foreign nationals cannot be racist because they do not benefit from their discrimination. Whereas the majority are inherently racist because they are privy to a system, be it political or societal, that favors their ethnicity.

I don't understand how definitively discriminatory actions cannot be considered racist, because of the characteristics of a person.  Do the characteristics of a person determine whether or not the actions discriminate? Or are the actions of the subject what determines if it itself is discrimination?

&amp;nbsp;

This topic aroused from a post in /r/nottheonion ([LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/35q377/i_cant_be_racist_because_im_an_ethnic_minority/)) and the subject of the article says:

&gt;I, an ethnic minority woman, cannot be racist or sexist towards white men, because racism and sexism describe structures of privilege based on race and gender.


&gt;Therefore, women of colour and minority genders cannot be racist or sexist, since we do not stand to benefit from such a system.

Not quite. I think you may have misunderstood one or more of the arguments that have lead some to suggest that minorities can't be  racist or practice racism. *Anyone* can discriminate or act bigoted or discriminatory. But from a sociological standpoint, *racism* is more than simple discrimination. 

Sure: some will quote dictionary.com and say that 'racism' is any discrimination or bigotry based on race. But that 'by the book' definition doesn't really help us address root causes of societal inequality. There's a sketch on the TV show *Upright Citizens Brigade* in which a racist character looks to find a group to direct his racism toward that won't be damaging and unacceptable and settles on the Laplanders (residents of the extreme north of Norway, Sweden, and Finland - about 200,000 people). The joke is that a white, middle-American guy being racist toward Laplanders is almost as good as being non-racist: in that his racism will be very unlikely to affect anyone in his daily life (of course, because this is comedy, he suddenly encounters Laplanders everywhere and is forced to again confront his racism).

A member of a minority group being 'racist' (bigoted or discriminatory) toward white people is just like a white guy discriminating against Laplanders. On the one hand -society's general preference for white people makes his discrimination more or less non-effective. So few minorities are in positions of authority where they could even effectively discriminate against majority groups; fewer still will achieve those positions by being overtly discriminatory against the majority. Only ultra-insular communities would ever permit a minority person to attain a rank sufficient to discriminate against majority persons: think ultra-orthodox religious communities or radical racial groups. Mainstream whites aren't trying to join Hasidic Jewish synagogues or the Black Panthers any more than blacks are trying to join the KKK. 

Sure: excluding *anyone* from *any* group based on race is the dictionary definition of 'racism'. But you have to ask yourself - does excluding members of a majority group from insular, race-based identification societies damage those excluded in any way? Aside from hurting their feelings, are members of the majority racial or ethnic groups damaged in a systematic fashion by bigotry and discrimination by members of minority groups? If not, I don't think that 'racism' is a correct label to apply.

racial discrimination and racism arent the same thing. im doing a cultural studies unit at uni and over the last decade it has been accepted fairly widely (social attitudes change quickly, 50 years ago theres a fair chance you would hate black people) that racism is a *structure* of power relations and oppression which white people can't be a victim of (within a white majority country) because it operates as white privilege, a system that privileges you and on some level oppresses racial minorities.

"For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. 

This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due my exposure to the idea on reddit/other internet sources, and partly because I've never been in an environment where sexual encounters are frequent. I don't think I'm of the party that has difficulty understanding consent. I also understand that there may be a great deal of fear for some women that they may be raped, and I don't wish to sound as though I'm downplaying that. But I have a fear myself of being falsely accused, or accused in a case where consent is retroactively removed. I don't think of this potential as being very high; I don't think most women are that vindictive; however in the event that it occurs it seems the results can be devastating. I've personally spoken to someone who has gone through this process and it took him almost a year to clear his name. 

I don't want this fear; I'm very open to the idea that it may be exaggerated in the media I've read, or that there are faults in my reasoning. But these are potentials and I can't seem to confirm them on my own; maybe someone else can poke some holes.

Congratulations on getting into, and being able to go to college. I hope it's a fabulous experience for you.

&gt;But I have a fear myself of being falsely accused, or accused in a case where consent is retroactively removed. I don't think of this potential as being very high; I don't think most women are that vindictive; however in the event that it occurs it seems the results can be devastating.

It would be a very scary situation.  As would hundreds of other situations that might occur.  The constant in all those situations would be you.   Remember, fears are internal things.  Therefore, should be dealt with internally.  That is, instead of worrying about what a partner might potentially do, make sure you are confident in what you do. 

Nothing wrong with telling a partner(s) that you have this concern too.  Discuss it with them.  Your feelings are valid, your concern exists.  How your partner(s) react to this disclosure might help you decide if they are a good choice.  Might sooth your fears.  There is a lot of power in communication. 

&gt; I don't think I'm of the party that has difficulty understanding consent

Knowing it's an issue of consent is no small thing.  Get familiar with the language, and comfortable using it when applicable.  Use more communication instead of less.  Don't assume your partners know much about consent, actually have the talks.  

Whether you want a plethora of sexual partners or a single monogamous honey, you can learn by and teach each other better communication (not just about consent) which will directly reduce the possibility of any ... misunderstandings, or hook ups with unstable people.  

Also, I want to point out that you are not immune to sexual assault because you are a young man.  Read the stats below with the understanding that some of those (90% +) unreported assault victims are men.  

As you make friends, and lovers, have each others backs.  Learn how to keep each other safe and do so.  Don't settle for hook-ups with people you don't trust, or friends who don't respect you or others.  Make friends with both genders and have everyone's back.  Don't fall into that us vs. them fear baiting malarkey. You're stepping off into your future. Make it, and the relationships in it as positive and unlikely to have issues as possible.

* One in 5 women and one in 16 men are sexually
assaulted while in college (i).
* More than 90% of sexual assault victims on college
campuses do not report the assault (c)
* 63.3% of men at one university who self-reported
acts qualifying as rape or attempted rape admitted
to committing repeat rapes (j)


&gt;**Crime reports**
* Rape is the most under-reported crime; 63% of
sexual assaults are not reported to police (o).
Only 12% of child sexual abuse is reported to the
authorities (g).
* The prevalence of false reporting is between
2% and 10%. For example, a study of eight U.S.
communities, which included 2,059 cases of sexual
assault, found a 7.1% rate of false reports (k).
A study of 136 sexual assault cases in Boston found
a 5.9% rate of false reports (j). Researchers studied
812 reports of sexual assault from 2000-03 and
found a 2.1% rate of false reports (h).

The *Homo sapiens* component of Earth is preparing to initiate reproduction by copying Earth's structure onto other planets like Mars; not only in terms of atmospheric composition, but Earth will also give Mars many of its species and possibly its ecosystems as well. The Earth maintains relatively constant conditions over time, like surface temperature, ocean salinity and pH, and atmospheric composition, and these relatively constant conditions are homeostasis.

"Marriage as a word comes from the Middle english word *mariage*, which according to sources from Wikipedia, comes from around 1200-1300 CE. Word comes from another Old French word then to a Latin word *marītāre*, which describes a husband and wife. Adding on top of that, many modern religions using the word to describe the ceremony as a marriage between one man and one woman, I see that the word Marriage is intrinsically religious. 

Now moving to modern day, Marriage is changing as many people are adding to/changing the meaning to a word that many people use as a religious word. People are getting up in arms about these and I can see their points. Marriage in a lot of religions these days is still defined as one man and one woman. Now have a court/government adding to/changing that definition of that word, this is where I believe the whole issue is. The issue with people not wanting gay marriage based off religious beliefs is because a word is being used for something that it does not mean to them. Marriage is/from religion and should keep it that way. We need to rename Marriage in the government to remove this part of the issue that the anti-gay marriage community has with it.  

Now I know it still won't remove the whole problem that the anti-gay community has with gay marriage but I believe it will remove everyone who dislikes that this word, that is so entrenched in religion, is being redefined by a government decision. I even see a huge problem with these, I am not religious and completely for two consenting people getting married, no matter who/what they are. The government needs to change its vocabulary so that when you want your union to be legal, you go get a Civil Union(Or whatever we call it) from the government. But if you want to get married, you must find a religion that accepts your union. This returns marriage to Religion and I believe removes a huge part of the problems we are having in the acceptance of this practice.  

[Source of Etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage#Etymology)

HUGE EDIT: So /u/awa64 and /u/cptal has brought to my attention some information. The intrinsic nature of the word marriage that I was bringing up has some flaws. The act of marriage seems to have been more of a social thing rather than a religious thing off the bat. The church seemed to basically be the best at keeping records and the sacrament didn't come until later. So even though the nature of the word has been pretty much a religious definition for a while, the word itself is not intrinsically religious. [Here](http://www.sexarchive.info/ATLAS_EN/html/history_of_marriage_in_western.html) and [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1awx09/does_marriage_really_have_its_roots_in_religion/c91ik9s) are their sources they brought to me. 

So with further communications with others, I have been bringing up that society is changing the word marriage and my view is more of a fix to speed up that change at least on the religious vs government front. The word will change in society but that takes a long time. As /u/GAB104 and a few others pointed out, that religion has change a bit from what it used to be. The whole owning your wife and stuff seems to come up a lot. So my view has changed a little but I still view that changing the government wording to something else would be a good thing to do as to remove the current problems that many religious people(That care about the issue) have with the definition of that word being changed. Here in this comment, I quickly chat about my experience with Mormons that have issues with gay marriage: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3df9or/cmv_marriage_is_between_one_man_and_one_woman/ct4n55g

The word marriage is just a word. It isn't intrinsically *anything*. It means whatever we've collectively decided it means, and for quite some time now it's been used to describe a romantic union, especially from a legal standpoint.

The government isn't changing the definition of anything. It's simply allowing gay people to operate under the umbrella of marriage like straight people already do.

"First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and I can admit when I am wrong.

I do not buy into the whole argument of 'just because our parents brought us into the world, we owe them our lives.' Whether a child was brought into the world by choice or not, I don't think that being born should impose a debt of respect on the child. 

Furthermore, I think that this respect needs to be earned. I define respect in this context as 'regard for another person's rational ability, trusting that they can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out.'

This is why I think that giving the reason 'because I said so' is a total cop out. If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect. 

Don't get me wrong, I think it is crucial for a child to be told when they are wrong so that they don't grow up into narcissistic asshats. However, I think that they deserve a logical conversation with a parent until one side admits, of his own accord, that he is in the wrong.

If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect.

I think you will find that as a parent, this would be an impossible situation. You say that ""respect needs to be earned"", but isn't this a two way street? Maybe you think the parent who says ""because I said so"" hasn't done enough to earn the child's respect. But has the child done anything to earn respect either? If the parent tried to rationally explain why they're right to the child, how confident are you that the child will understand and ""can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out"". If they can't, then a rational two-way discussion just isn't going to happen.

And if such a discussion can't happen yet, what now? Should the parent and child just ""agree to disagree""? Of course not. I wouldn't frame it as some kind of ""debt"" that arises out of giving birth, but I think its pretty widely acknowledged that parents are responsible for their child's behavior, even before the child is wise enough to understand complicated reasoning. As a third part, I *expect* other parents to keep their children in line, even if their children aren't smart enough to understand why certain behavioral expectations exist.

And similar phenomena happen for all positions of authority. If a police officer is directing traffic, he doesn't have to explain to you the details of what's going on. You have to listen to him anyway. ""Because I said so"" would be a perfectly reasonable thing for him to say when him explaining what's going on in more detail would hold up traffic (especially if you then decide for whatever reason that you disagree). Similarly, there are many employer-employee relationships where ""because I said so"" should be good enough for you. One hopes that there is a good reason behind the requests, but the employee is in no way entitled to a full breakdown of exactly why everything works the way it does, especially when time is of the essence. Its embedded into the nature of these relationships that you follow orders.","In principle, I agree with you that parents do not simply deserve unconditional respect just by virtue of being their parents. But there are several aspects that I'd like to comment on.

First of all, your parents changed your diapers and by the time you're even just 5, they've invested a whole lot of time and money in you. That is enough to deserve some respect and gratitude. That doesn't mean they can't lose it because they do crappy things, but it is worth quite a bit in itself, and it does deserve respect.

In the case of arguments, there's two points that I think are important. First of all, you'll have found that there are many situations in life where ""because I said so"" is something you'll have to submit to if you want to achieve certain goals. Ever had a job? Ever had a boss who told you what to do? Did they always talk you through the reasons for the required actions step by step? It would be nice if they did, because even in a job I'd quite like to know why I'm doing what I'm doing, but they're not required to because they give you money.

If your parents say you can't wear a cap at the table because they said so, then that's fair enough. They're feeding you. You're free to get up and move out and buy your own food, but as long as they're providing for you, they can make rules, even if the rules are stupid and arbitrary and you don't agree with them. I personally don't think that's a very good attitude and I hope I won't be that kind of parent, but I can't really argue with it.

Also, I've had similar conversations with parents because, as I said, I do in principle agree with you, and I'd very much like to be a parent who explains things to their children and encourages them not to take things for granted or as given without questioning them. But I've been told that this just gets tedious sometimes. Maybe you spend 15 hours a day actively dealing with your child. Children ask all the questions and want to do all the things, and if you at some point run out of patience and don't want to explain something for the nth time, I think saying ""because I said so"" is still not ideal, but perfectly understandable. 

With your last statement, I'm not sure which age you have in mind. But people of any age really sometimes suck at logic, and children even more so, so there are arguments that can't be solved this way because no side will admit out of their own accord that they're wrong. And in some cases there isn't even necessarily wrong or right, because it depends on how much you care about certain things. You can't drag arguments out forever.

I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for drug distribution they can choose to die. This would decrease prison population and relief funding to the prison system. Less people = less taxpayers have to spend. The prisoner would get to choose if they want to die, but the state would perform the execution. This would only apply to people 18 years or older.

Prisoners sometimes have to endure very horrible things while in prison. Rape, sexual assault and violence affect many prisoners that are serving time for theft, drugs, etc. This would also apply to criminals who are terminally ill and suffer everyday from the side effects.
People are given life sentences without parole for non violent offenses sometimes.

I believe it is right to give these criminals an option to end their life's so they don't have to suffer in prison if they don't want to.

"I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever.


 Smokers say its relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need a smoke but ran out/cant leave to smoke at the moment etc, so if it is relaxing, it also adds to stress. Not to mention it's relaxing because it's a form of self fulfilling effect. It is relaxing because their body wants those chemicals, and they are giving it to the body.


All the unhealthy effects are well known, I'm not going to list all them.


It pollutes the enviroment. All the chemicals in the smoke, and the filters... how many smokers actually throw away the cigarette butts. I am sure 95% of them just flick them on the ground... look around outside anyplace where people go on smoke breaks. They are everywhere, blowing around, getting in the water, and animals eat them.


Im sure the main counterpoint to this is going to be ""how can you or the government tell me what i can do with my body and health""...

They already do though. They pass laws all the time because they say it's for our own good. Seatbelt laws for one example. The only person you hurt by not wearing one is yourself, but they make that a law. They have laws about what toxins and chemicals can be in our bug sprays, paint, and food, so it isn't like they dont already do that.

"*note: I mean any and all cases like this, I'm just using the case below as an example*.

I'm sure many of you have seen the viral Facebook video of a mother shaming her 13-year old daughter. As of last night (when I checked) the video had over 10 million views.

Yes, the goal was to end her daughter's explicit sexual activity online whilst also sending a message to all her friends that her daughter has been lying about her age. That's an admirable goal. The daughter's actions are *unquestionably wrong*, I'm not arguing otherwise. 

But the method the mother chose to get to that goal is reckless and shortsighted. Did she not consider the consequences of having her daughter shamed in front of millions of people? Her daughter has to go to school, a place full of people who I'm sure have seen the video. And let's face it, high/middle schoolers are vicious. Some people kill themselves from bullying.

Not only that, but the mother said her daughter's full name in front of 10 million people. I mean, what happens to the chances of a career for this 13-year old now? It'll follow her forever. She could say goodbye to any chance of becoming president. Not to mention that she's an easy target for doxxing.

This is just a guess (because everyone's different), but I imagine that their relationship is ruined now. The daughter will probably be more secretive and distrustful of her mother. The relationship doesn't seem to be grounds for open communication, either.

I think the mental and emotional health of this girl has been severely damaged and any career she could've pursued will be hindered by her mother's reckless parenting.

"Throwaway account, my main is used for school.  

I'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She frequently brings up marriage and talks about how she believes I'll never propose to her, and I've told her that I'm honestly not sure how I feel about the whole concept of marriage. I would have no problem staying with her for my entire life, but I just don't understand how a ring and a piece of paper makes any difference.

Let me outline my preconceptions here: My parents' marriage fell apart due to infidelity and divorce. I watched my mom cheat on my dad, take all his money in court, and leave him psychologically damaged until the day he died. Admittedly it has me a bit scared.

Here are the benefits I often hear claimed about marriage, along with my response to them:

* More sex: We've been like bunnies for the whole relationship (at least twice a day) and honestly I have a pretty low sex drive. It's already more than enough.

* Children: I don't want kids, don't have kids, and am 100% sterile by choice. Nothing to do about it. She is equally happy to go without them.

* Added financial benefit / tax breaks: We already contribute equally to the relationship in terms of finances. We end up paying for everything about 50/50. Tax breaks? Ok, sure, but that's not going to sell me on it right off the bat.


Now here are some drawbacks I often see cited about marriage, along with my response:


* Expense: A ring is supposed to cost three month's salary?! A wedding costs over $10,000?! I'm a grad student, for crying out loud. This kind of stuff is absolutely not affordable, and even if it was it seems like a huge waste just to conform to a social norm. Paying more for a little bit of metal and rock than for a decent used car seems absolutely insane to me.


* Divorce Risk: Statistics don't lie. I have a 50/50 chance of going through exactly what my late father did.


I hate seeing how sad the thought of just being my girlfriend forever (but not my wife) makes her.  I love this girl a lot, but I am also a very rational and logical person and can't seem to find the personal justification for marriage.

Please, try to change my view - and thank you.

Edit 1:  Whoever you are, thank you for mass-downvoting all my responses.  I'm trying to have a civil discourse, and if I'm frustrating you I don't mean anything negative by it.

Edit 2:  Thank you all for your insight.  I have awarded one delta on this topic but for the most part I have not been convinced that marriage is for me.  Consider this CMV closed, although I may check back later to respond to any trailing opinions.

I appreciate your time, and thank you very much.

"Hello CMV!

First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). This has potentially shaped my ideas on the matter but I thought I'd throw it out there. Please don't judge me on my politics but on the content of the CMV.
I believe that in a free society people have the right to decide whether they should keep a baby or not, women have the right to abort or raise a child. However I believe that men deserve the same right after sex with regards to the child (it takes two to tango). If a mother decides to keep the child then the father deserves the right to accept, or opt out of, fatherhood including all of the repercussions and payments that could be associated with such.

I understand that the state assumes the right of the child &gt; the right of the parent, however I believe strongly that the father has the right to continue to live his life without sinking payments into a child which was optionally chosen. If a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life.

Or on the opposite, if a mother is given the option to keep a child, willingly knowing the father does not want to, then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself, as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child.
Obviously this excludes rape and all other implications, this is only within consensual sex.

TL;DR: Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood, and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for, in a consensual Pro-Choice environment.

EDIT: Slight confusion/comments regarding abortion, I believe that it is solely the woman's responsibility as to whether she should abort or not, it is her ""pro choice"", however fathers have the right to ""opt out"" of fatherhood, or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it.
EDIT2: This is going pretty well, some good discussions. As suggested another way to put this would be 'Committing to sex is not committing to parenthood"". 
TheScamr worded this nicely:
&gt;Right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother, either financially, custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption. Pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood. OP is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition : consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood, either financially, custodially or emotionally.

EDIT3: This has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion, so thank you CMV. It's a controversial topic because while Men should have the same rights as Women, the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father, but not the mother. I think /u/Billy90 put forward the best argument against this.

"Hi Reddit. With all the news over the past couple weeks regarding Caitlyn Jenner’s transition and coming out, I feel now is a good time to discuss gender’s role in society and its position in how people identify as an individual. I would like to preface myself by saying that I identify as a pansexual cis-male, and I certainly have zero issues with people that are transgendered. I do, however, get very confused as to *why* some people are transgendered.


Many people use the phrase, “I am a male trapped in a female’s body,” or, “my body is male but my brain is female.” What does this even mean? From a very young age, people are raised with ideas imposed upon us that dictate what boys are and what girls are, and these perceptions have nothing to do with the biological sex of someone and are typically based upon baseless stereotypical personality traits or what that gender should like to do. We are taught boys should play with toy cars and tools while girls are supposed to like barbies and dresses. These stereotypes are completely disparate from the reality that people are often multi-faceted, and might like many things across several disciplines and across several “gender” boundaries. I, personally, love to wrench my own car, build things, and in the same day I might decide to look totally different and wear makeup as an artistic outlet or go out shopping with friends to look at heels. These interests have nothing to do with my biological sex, and shouldn’t have an affect on how I identify.


Society has dictated that girls do certain things and boys do certain things. What does this mean when someone who is anatomically male tends to like a lot of the things that the opposite gender stereotypically likes? I think it’s unfair to oneself to say, “I like girl things so therefore I’m a girl,” or, “I like looking like a girl so I’m a girl.” This idea of outward presentation equating to one’s gender identity seems restrictive to me. I question how many people would identify as transgender if these societal norms became antiquated and everyone was truly free to express all sides of themselves regardless of physical sex. It should not be odd to be a very “feminine” person (makeup, hair, dress, etc) and be anatomically male and identify as a male despite one’s outward aesthetic. There shouldn’t even be an emphasis in society as to what gonads someone possesses. I believe far less people would identify as transgender, especially considering some people that are transgendered do not want sexual reassignment surgery, if we, as a society, were more open minded about individuality instead of trying to group people together based on their gender. If one doesn’t even want to have SRS, but they want to live their life “as a wo/man,” how is this not simply perpetuating the heteronormative ideologies imposed upon us? One shouldn’t have to explain to society who they are with their gender just because they don’t fit into the false dichotomy of male/female.

"Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to $15/hour. While many would expect this to strengthen the lower class and only decreasing the wealth of the upper class, I feel as if it would end up hurting those it is meant to help.   
  
These company's would now have to spend much more of their budget on paying employees, and it's not as if they're going to magically have more money. I understand that the increase of wealth in the lower class would eventually circulate back to the business's, but I highly doubt it would be enough to make up for the increased wages of their employees, and it definitely wouldn't happen right away. Since I highly doubt the CEO or other upper management would take cuts from their pay to make up for this, that leaves two possible solutions that I can see: 
  
The first would be to decrease the amount of employees. If approximately an equal percentage of employees are let go to the increase in pay the company will be able to function without upper management having to take a pay cut. While those who are able to keep there jobs would be greatly helped by this, for the most part it would just increase the unemployment rate; with these lay offs happening in a large portion of minimum wag paying company's there would be no demand for jobs while the supply would be sky rocketing. 
  
The other solution would be for the company to increase prices (for retail/restaurants). With increasing prices nobody would have to loose their job, however it would still end up hurting the lower class. Practically all people get there basic necessities and luxuries from retail and grocery stores- the lower and middle classes especially rely heavily on major stores such as Walmart or Target. Even if your paycheck is increasing you'd still end up paying more the things you already buy, taking a large chunk of your paycheck. 
  
While ideally an increased minimum wage seems perfect, it would in reality end up creating a combination of these two things. I'm sure I didn't hit on some points, so please try to change my view on this, I, as a minimum wage employee myself, would love to have a good reason to support raising it.

EDIT: ∆ Okay, my views been changed. I still don't think something as drastic as upping it to $15/hour right away would be a good idea, but I think a gradual increase could be really good. The biggest things that helped my view change were the historical instances of MW rising, the average proportion of price increase vs. wage increase, as well as the fact that businesses are already operating with the minimum number of employees and that jobs wouldn't just become expendable. I really wish I could reply to more comments but I can't at the moment, thanks to everybody who replied!","I've had this debate many times on reddit, and typically the same arguments are made against raising the minimum wage. You've fallen into the same thinking patterns. I'll post an older response I've made to similar arguments if that's ok.


&gt; Reading through these comments I have read the same complaints about raising the minimum wage Ad nauseam. Here are some points I would like you all to consider. I'll go point by point.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1.Raising the minimum wage will mean that less people will have jobs.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Possibly. But this is not the case for MOST businesses. Businesses already employ as few people as the possibly can. Remember, every job is an expense..a cost...something they attempt to eliminate any chance they get(this is not meant to be a slight at businesses...it is the smartest way to do business and I would do the same if I was in charge).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Raising the minimum wage wouldn't mean that businesses would just start firing people left and right because all of a sudden they cant make money. Think of it this way. If Mcdonald's all of a sudden had to pay the guy who does the fries 9$ instead of 7.25...would they fire the french fries guy? Of course not. They NEED him.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **TLDR : Businesses already attempt to eliminate jobs whenever possible. Companies may attempt to rid themselves of a few minimum wage workers, but the vast majority of the jobs are much more difficult to eliminate.**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 2 .Prices are all going to go up to counteract the increase in cost of production.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Possibly. But there's a lot people are missing here. First we need to discuss how a business will deal with an increase in costs. There are two areas the money can come from. Either the customer must pay more money for your good, or the company must accept a lower profit margin for each good they sell(99% of the time it is a combination of both). How much that gets passed to the customer is determined by price elasticity...which is pretty much how much the demand of a good will decrease if you raise the price
&gt; (Example : Starbucks is WAY more elastic that diabetes medication..you cant exactly walk away from your insulin shots if the price goes up.)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Now.. will prices rise for all of us if minimum wage goes up? Possibly. We need to consider a few things first:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A) Price stickiness and Price elasticity. Some goods and services simply cannot go up sharply in price much even if the cost goes up to make the good. The goods you most commonly buy have a higher elasticity and probably wont go up all that much.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; B) Increase in demand. While companies may make less of a profit margin..they will sell MORE in the aggregate. Since minimum wage workers spend almost 100% of what they make, the money goes back into the businesses almost immediately and the money circulates. This is golden for a consumer based economy(thats us btw).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; C) Not every single good produced in America uses a ton of minimum wage labor. This one is pretty much common sense. If your business doesn't employ much minimum wage labor, your costs won't increase much.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; D) Lastly, lets consider that our minimum wage adjusted for inflation(1996 base) is about 4.97.
&gt; It was its highest in the year 1968, at 7.21. Remember, the 1950s and 1960s was the longest period of economic growth and prosperity in the nations history. I'm not suggesting that this is due to the minimum wage, but this fact makes short work of the idea that the minimum wage going up will lead to economic meltdown..
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I may edit this later as I am sure there are points that I have left out. But lets get down to whether or not it is a good idea to have a minimum wage..and whether or not it should be increased.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In order to answer this question, we only need to ask if the benefits of having a higher minimum wage are worth the costs we must incur. To me it is an obvious yes. Minimum wage workers will have more spending power, and the economy will be stronger overall. Henry Ford said it best in my opinion. ""I pay my workers more so they have enough money to buy my cars!""
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, don't believe the hype when businesses say that it will kill their business if they have to pay workers 9 bucks. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. that low wage workers try to get ANYTHING businesses will say this.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted 8 hour workdays
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted lunch breaks
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted weekends off
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted vacations
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted safe working conditions
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when they would have to pay everyone the same regardless of race or gender
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when it came to workers wanting to unionize
&gt; I could go on all day. A healthy minimum wage wont cripple businesses any more than the rest of these things did.","&gt;Even if your paycheck is increasing you'd still end up paying more the things you already buy, taking a large chunk of your paycheck.

The current price of goods is where it is with everyone making Minimum wage AND ABOVE.

Not everyone will have their wages increased. So where someone making $7.55 has their wages increased 100%, the price of goods would not increase 100% as well, because not 100% of people had their wages increased.

We also have to factor in that with these people having an increase in buying power. At $7.55, you barley have a disposable income. Increase that and their spending power increases. This would increase the profits of the stores that had to increase their salary budgets. It would essentially offset it.",58,"&gt;Even if your paycheck is increasing you'd still end up paying more the things you already buy, taking a large chunk of your paycheck.

&gt; It was its highest in the year 1968, at 7.21. Remember, the 1950s and 1960s was the longest period of economic growth and prosperity in the nations history. I'm not suggesting that this is due to the minimum wage, but this fact makes short work of the idea that the minimum wage going up will lead to economic meltdown..
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I may edit this later as I am sure there are points that I have left out. But lets get down to whether or not it is a good idea to have a minimum wage..and whether or not it should be increased.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In order to answer this question, we only need to ask if the benefits of having a higher minimum wage are worth the costs we must incur. To me it is an obvious yes. Minimum wage workers will have more spending power, and the economy will be stronger overall. Henry Ford said it best in my opinion. ""I pay my workers more so they have enough money to buy my cars!""
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, don't believe the hype when businesses say that it will kill their business if they have to pay workers 9 bucks. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. that low wage workers try to get ANYTHING businesses will say this.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted 8 hour workdays
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted lunch breaks
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted weekends off
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted vacations
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted safe working conditions
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when they would have to pay everyone the same regardless of race or gender
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when it came to workers wanting to unionize
&gt; I could go on all day. A healthy minimum wage wont cripple businesses any more than the rest of these things did.",r2,0.8,0.5,0.7,0.6,0.5,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.0,0.8,0.7,0.6,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,r2,,
"I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This is exactly why I think he's the right choice.

First, I think it means you get less backlash against the movement in general. If she were to interrupt another candidate, more people would use that as evidence against the BlackLivesMatter movement in general. That means more people would use the incident to negatively paint the entire BLM movement since they are less familiar with it, while the Sanders supporters who would be upset would be the least likely to do this.

Second, it forces Bernie to make a bigger deal out of racial injustice in his campaign. Even if he doesn't support the people who interrupt him, he has to at least issue some statement that says ""Why'd you pick on me? Here's everything I'm doing to help . . ."" and suddenly, it's a major part of his campaign.

Sanders *does* have a solid [page on racial injustice](https://berniesanders.com/issues/racial-justice) on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to [O'Malley's page](https://martinomalley.com/policy/criminal-justice/), Sanders has a lot of work to do. Interestingly enough, O'Malley began to better flush out his policy on criminal just after he was interrupted by BLM protesters.

Forcing his hand in making his stances on racial justice more public and more thorough is the best way to make it a bigger campaign issue, and is the best possible result for the BLM movement at large.

"I attribute my agnosticism to this very theory. Looking at the Big Bang from a purely scientific perspective, we know, or think we know, that there was absolutely nothing in our universe before the Big Bang.

Now of course this nothingness is incomprehensible and even typing this it boggles my mind, but science's explanation is that nothingness caused the Big Bang. Now there are several theories to this, such as somehow two universes rubbing or colliding together which sparked the event. I'm no scientist and I'm sure people will correct me (please do), but the point is we really don't know how the Big Bang formed from what we consider to be nothing.

I tend to think, though, that some conscious entity had to be the catalyst that caused the event. It would seem that if there was nothing in our universe, some extra-dimensional being from another universe would have had to insert itself into ours, which sparked the event known as the Big Bang. I believe the being to be conscious because of the intentional way in which our universe seemed to form, and life sprung up. This begins to err on the side of intelligent design, but I do believe human beings, our consciousness, feelings, empathy, etc, have to be attributed to something higher.

I believe that entity to be God. Not necessarily in the Christian sense, or even that this being is benevolent, but that's my theory. Change my view.

Edited post to clarify that I believe the entity to be conscious and intentional in its insertion into our universe and subsequent cause of the Big Bang and our existence.

"If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available. On a nationwide scale, decreasing population means available work. Natural resources of food, water, fuel, and other materials are becoming scarcer everyday. On a global scale, less population means more available goods to all. What result(s) of an increasing population size could surpass these benefits? If we were hypothetically at the growth cap for the human population, would everybody still get frantic like when it's is brought up that the U.S. born citizen population is reproducing below replacement?

Edit: it seems a lot of the response pertain to economy. I suppose I was wrong in respect to a declining population being beneficial in this aspect. However, I still seem to feel that a shrinking population would benefit us as a species. Our survival, and that of our environment, would be better off with less people. But still, I'm open to changing my view.","Shrinking populations are actually really disruptive and dangerous things.  There are many reasons for this but it all basically boils down to less economic activity is bad.

First lets consider the direct effects.  Property prices would plunge.  If there are 100 houses and 100 families to fill them you need to build a new house to accommodate the 101st family.  The material supplies, land value, and profit margin set the cost of that house.  The value of the land is based on what the last piece of land in the area sold for.  This is a nice stable system and allows every one of the 100 families who already owns a house to have a house worth hundreds of thousands of dollars (as thats what a new house costs).  If however you have 99 families and 100 houses that 100th house is worthless.  No one wants it, so no one buys it, no one uses it, AND more importantly, if that house is worth $0.00 all of the other houses are worth $0.00 as well.  We instantly destroyed the entire community's home values.  Detroit has a shrinking population and you can buy houses there for less than a cheese burger.

Next the stock market.  Stock prices are based, to a large degree, on anticipated future growth of the companies.  Publicly traded companies tend to sell for 12X their annual earnings.  Privately traded companies tend to sell for 7X their annual earnings.  This is because of the difference in growth prospects.  With a declining population and thus declining business activity the stock market would take a huge hit wiping out huge amounts of savings (from people who already lost all the equity in their homes).

Next comes government debts.  Right now government services in all of the western world are financed by deficit spending.  Lenders lend money because they feel the country will be able to pay it back eventually.  If however the GDP starts to go down investors won't lend and governments will fall into the trap that snared Greece.

I could go on and on and on.  But population decline is really bad news.","I'm an evolutionary ecologist by profession and I can provide a little perspective here that may change your view.

Carrying capacity and population growth (r/K selection):     

Check out Fig. 5 in [this link](http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/an-introduction-to-population-growth-84225544)    
    
On that graph there is a place on the x-axis marked K.   
   
That graph is a line that represents how a population would grow under normal conditions. Meaning that it isn't growing exponentially, it's growing logistically.    
K is the carrying capacity of the habitat. It's the number of individuals of a species that can be supported by the habitat.   
   
K-selected animals would have a population around K. They have stable populations and relatively low mortality and will generally hover right around where they should be.     
     
They are called K-selected because they are selected for populations right around the carrying capacity.    
     
r-selected species are 'rate-selected'. So they are selected to be growing at a maximal rate. That's because they are usually something like mice that will have huge mortality, so the individuals are all pumping out as many offspring as possible.     
    
r-selected organisms will generally have a population right around K/2. That's because that's where the slope of that line is steepest, so that's where it's growing fastest.      
     
(Edit: To clarify, each species would have a different graph. So the mouse would have a different graph from the cat. The mouse population would be at K/2 for the mice, not K/2 for the cats.)
     
**Now check out Fig 8.**   
That's human population since the advent of agriculture. Notice it's not a logistic growth curve. Our population is growing exponentially. That's because we're K-selected, but we haven't reached K yet.     
When we reach K what's going to happen is that we'll exceed it. When a population is growing like ours it will exceed K, then there will be famine, disease, death, real apocalyptic shit. That will drop the population well below K. The population will then start to rebound and go towards K again. The it will exceed it again and fall again. But this time the rise above K will be smaller and when it falls again it won't fall as far below K. It will sort-of oscillate about K for a while then level out and hover around K.     
     
Problem with human population growth is that we are destroying all of the habitat that would define K. So we're not just exponentially going for K, we're also dragging K towards us. And in the end, when we reach K, we may well have lowered that bar far further than 7 billion.

"I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununpentium) or [ununtrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununtrium), I got the feeling that it's almost cheating to call these things elements and add them to the periodic table.

The atoms are created in a lab, usually by slamming two other heavy atoms together in a collider. The resulting atom decays in microseconds and does not naturally occur outside the lab.

Calling these things new elements strikes me as the same thing as grabbing two random objects, (say a water bottle and a book), holding them together in your hands and saying, ""Look! I've created a bookbottle!""

The object will only last until you let go of it, and then be torn apart by the stronger force, in this case, gravity. It's not a new tool or object and you can't file a patent for it.

Ununpentium and its ilk are not elements if they can't be found outside the lab, cannot exist as more than a few atoms at a time, or last more than a few microseconds. They are interesting experiments to be sure, but they are not new elements.

Change my view.


EDIT:

Wow, I really didn't see how many gaping holes my argument had. 

What I've learned:

&gt;Short half life

It's short by our human standards, but that means nothing on the universal scale. Our lives are nothing on the scale of the universe, that doesn't mean we aren't alive.

&gt;Very few atoms at a time

This is just a limit on what we're able to synthesize. Massive quantities could theoretically be created in a supernova.

&gt;Not outside the lab.

Where it is synthesized doesn't matter. The lab is still in the universe, so it could be said that the universe is creating these atoms.

"I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually rich white kids that already have a socioenconomic advantage. I was a regular upper-middle class guy who went to public school. I loved it. My school was great. We went on fun field trips, and even a trip to Europe. Homeschooling your kid is just insurance that he/she will be socially awkward, and disadvantaged. Lots of homeschooling involves religious indoctrination, and very one-sided opinions. In public school you are exposed to many different views, opinions, and types of people. These problems would be solved if everyone had to go to public school. Everyone would have an equal education, and equal opportunity.

A lot of good teachers quit from the public schools due to red tape and excessive amounts of paperwork involved. These teachers, the ones of talked to (who are some of the best I've ever had) argue that they much prefer teaching where they have more freedom to be creative and instill real knowledge and fun activities, not run through a curriculum as quickly as possible to meet state standards.

He was able to make them love and respect him, and they all learned a lot-Even the at-risk kids. I can tell you it's a lot more effective than handing out a blue diamond book every week and teaching to the test. 

If that doesn't get you, here's another point-The public school near my house was massive and I was barely even a number to them. Private schools are much smaller and more personal. Don't you think a lot of at-risk kids would benefit from having their teacher know them as more than just a name on a list of grades with 500-1000 other names on it? They don't have as much opportunity to sit in the back of the class and get away with murder. It also helps foster discussion, as smaller class sizes are easier to work with than massive ones. 

Also, in regards to bullying. Oftentimes, draconian state laws basically prohibit anything resembling coherent thought on that topic. I'm sure if you've been on reddit as long as I have, you've heard plenty of ""No tolerance policy"" stories. I've met people in real life that have had that happen to them. It's not the least bit uncommon.

"So if you haven't heard already, there was a recent [shooting in a Charleston church.](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3a8k4r/breaking_active_shooting_downtown_charleston/) Many reports are coming out with evidence that points it as a racially motivated hate crime. (I'm not here to argue whether or not it was, as the investigation is still ongoing and many developments have yet to come, but for the purpose of this discussion I'm going to assume it was.)  

Much like with the Elliot Rodgers case, there are many people already stating that this is purely a mental health issue and it's just the liberal media drumming up a race war and etc.  

I don't think it's fair to detract from those arguments, as there are many many people with mental illnesses living non-violently. Even if people with certain mental illnesses have a higher chance of committing violence, and even if most mass murderers do have some kind of mental illness, it shouldn't detract from the fact that there are social motivators that led them ultimately to taking others' lives. The reason I say it's ""disingenuous"" to downplay them is because it allows people who believe there's nothing wrong (eg. that racism is still a major problem) to persuade others that there's nothing wrong, even though there's evidence in the form of the killings that there's still a problem. 

In this case, it was the suspect's surrounding himself with racist rhetoric that led him so far down a path of hatred towards black people that he acted violently against them. In Elliot Rodger's case, it was his intense hatred of women not sleeping with him (and resentment of other men he saw as his 'competitors') that ultimately led him to go on his spree.  

I believe that bigoted hatred should also be addressed alongside mental illness, and shouldn't be downplayed by the media or the public whenever these issues arise. Especially since not all killers are mentally ill, and so addressing these motivators will still help reduce violence.","The Southern Poverty Law Center [tracks 939 hate groups across the United States](http://www.businessinsider.com/active-hate-groups-by-state-2014-2). It's hard to say exactly how many people are in these groups, but even if each has an average membership of only 30, that's nearly 30,000. On top of this, there are no doubt millions of serious racists or other sorts of bigots or other people with extreme views who don't belong to organized groups.

Yet despite these millions of people having ideas that we might think would cause them to want to shoot up black churches, bomb synagogues, or assassinate abortion doctors, these sorts of things are fairly rare.

That suggests that merely holding these ideas is *not* sufficient cause for a person of sound mind, who is at least vaguely socialized within mainstream society, to go out and kill people. Therefore, in the rare cases where that *does* occur, there must be some other proximate cause. Examining the histories of those who commit such acts, that other factor often seems to be mental illness.","Should we blame Adam Lanza's murder of elementary school kids on his veganism?  Maybe speculate on whether excessive emphasis on animals' value translates into a disdain for humanity?

Should we argue whether to blame Jared Loughner's attempted murder of Giffords on his goldbug conspiracy theories or his hatred of religion?

Should we pin James Holmes' theater shooting on his ""middle-of-the-road"" politics?  On his agnosticism and unwillingness to take a strong stance on atheism vs religion?

It's easy to pin murders on the politics one happens to hate.  But people of every political stripe commit murders for senseless reasons that cannot be attributed to their politics.

When people talk about these mass murders being due to insanity, it is not disingenuous.  They are trying to emphasize the senselessness and randomness of these crimes.

"Dear reader, let me re-introduce you to an argument known as [""Pascal's Wager""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager), which you probably know about if you decided to look here. 

From Wikipedia:
&gt;  It posits that humans all bet with their lives either that God exists or not. Given the possibility that God actually does exist and assuming an infinite gain or loss associated with belief or unbelief in said God (as represented by an eternity in heaven or hell), a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.). Pascal formulated the wager within a Christian framework. 

I am addressing the counter-arguments of ""Nature as not a proof of the existence of God"" and ""Argument from inauthentic belief"", which you should read about if you would like to talk to me about those.

Since I'm not great at reported speech, I will quote the thoughts of my imaginary atheist:

&gt;I am an atheist. I believe there is no deity or higher power which governs nature.

&gt;As such, I am most probably damned by a great number of religions.

&gt;If I love my child, and if wish it well, I must do everything in my power to secure that.

&gt;One of those things is instilling faith into my child. 

&gt;I should feign faith, as hard as I can, to make my child a believer, and a practicing one, at best.

&gt;That way, their faith will be sincere and strong, even if mine is not, saving them, and MAYBE EVEN me in the process.

I only see as conflicting the ""Argument from inconsistent revelations"",
&gt;Since there have been many religions throughout history, and therefore many conceptions of God (or gods), some assert that all of them need to be factored into the wager, in an argument known as the argument from inconsistent revelations. This, its proponents argue, would lead to a high probability of believing in ""the wrong god"", which, they claim, eliminates the mathematical advantage Pascal claimed with his Wager.

e but even so, instilling ANY faith could still be better than NO faith, more because a number of deities value believers more than non-believers.

As such, Change My View, from the standpoint that there is multiple religions, and, for the sake of argument, from the standpoint that there is only one religion in the world (imagine a planet of only Christians and atheists, or Jews and atheists, etc.)

tl;dr - I should teach my kid to believe in God and be a good human being, and not just the latter.

EDIT: I understand rule B and that is why I have given two options.

"After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read more fiction than nonfiction so let me give some examples. 

In the fiction category, I've read stephen king's ""the long walk"", ""needful things,"" and ""the shining""; i've read pretty much all of crichton's books, and almost all of dan brown books. All are  quite popular books. 

For comparison, the last 3 nonfictions I've read are [skunk works](http://www.amazon.com/Skunk-Works-Personal-Memoir-Lockheed/dp/0316743003/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433822539&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=skunk+works&amp;pebp=1433822538925&amp;perid=1EH2CEACB9PWNS9GT84H),"" ""[the code book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Code-Book-Science-Cryptography/dp/0385495323)"", and ""[Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea](http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Envy-Ordinary-Lives-North/dp/0385523912/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433822683&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=north+korea&amp;pebp=1433822683392&amp;perid=11JG0BF3QCH819XQN6N9) ""

See, my view isn't that fiction is boring. However, in the limited span of time I have, I'd rather read 1000 pages worth of Introductory Chemistry, than 1000 pages worth of Needful Things; I'd have learned a lot more in The Code Book about cryptography than anything I would have learned from reading Jurassic Park (some basics about DNA and molecular engineering). 

Because it's such a time sink, the amount of enjoyment from reading fiction is not worth the time it takes to read it. (1000 pages would take 1-2 days to read; I'd rather spend those 1-2 days watching movies or doing other time-sinking things that provides a much greater amount of pleasure). On the other hand, reading 1000 pages of nonfiction, while it would take even longer time, but it would let me get more out of it to be worth my time.

CMV that reading fiction is somehow worth the time that it takes. 

**edit:** I've changed my view in the sense that not *all* fiction are created equal and I probably had been reading too much shitty fiction. I will try to make some efforts to read more nonshitty fiction.

Fiction isn't a waste of time anymore than reading nonfiction.

Movies are great, but the nature of the medium often requires a massive simplification of story and characters to keep the run time reasonable. I've read enough books adapted for film to see how crippling the transition can be. Movies make up for this in other ways, but they never serve as a true substitute for a good book.

If managing your time is a big concern, there are always audiobooks.

It's fine to have a preference, but I don't see how you expect anyone to change your view, anymore than we could make you like broccoli if you just hated it. If you find movies 5x more enjoyable than fiction then you are clearly not getting out of it what many of us do. 

Movies are great, but the nature of the medium often requires a massive simplification of story and characters to keep the run time reasonable. I've read enough books adapted for film to see how crippling the transition can be. Movies make up for this in other ways, but they never serve as a true substitute for a good book.

If managing your time is a big concern, there are always audiobooks. Listen while you drive, do chores, etc. You certainly can't do those things (at least not well) while watching a movie.",r2,0.5,0.2,0.7,0.6,0.5,0.0,0.8,0.3,0.8,0.0,0.2,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.3,r1,,
"I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life.  I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; however, I do not feel like this stance has benefited me in the slightest.  In fact, given my regional location (the South or Southeast United States) it has probably hurt me personally more than anything.

I have not read Ayn Rand, nor do I ever intend to, as I consider her philosophy to be frankly immoral.  Moral people should look out for their fellow humans.

However, I believe that I would be better served by pursuing my own rational self-interest rather than spending even an ounce of my resources on the betterment of others who will just attribute my good deed to their god anyway most likely.  Donating to charity might prevent a child from dying from cancer, but I am not a child and I don't have cancer, so that extra dollar from my pocket is better spent being used as tax on my latest board game purchase.  This could be extended to other people that I consider friends, but I think it is a better use of my resources for me to aid my own comfort than to save a stranger's life.  

Things that will not change my view:  

* ""You aren't really describing objectivism! It really is a more nuanced..."" 

  I don't care.  I am not here to argue the definition of objectivism.  

* ""My wife/child/other family member was saved by...""  
Are you related to me?  Probably not as I have never had these sorts of problems, so I don't care.  It is good that your family member didn't die, but that has nothing to do with me.

* ""What if you needed help?""  
I probably wouldn't get it unless I was able to provide it for myself.

"To start off yes I am Mormon and no I am not offended by The Book of Mormon Musical. In fact I know a ton of very devout Mormons who have seen the play and they all said that they thought it was very funny. In fact the LDS (Mormon) church even bought ads in the Playbills of the musical to direct the audience to the official LDS website. Prominent political figures such as Hilary Clinton have also seen the play and didn't have any issues about it.

Yet at the same time there are certain religions in the United States that are big no-no's to make fun of.  This seems slightly counter intuitive. 

I only have the view from a Mormon perspective but there have been other pieces of media that openly mock and slap at Mormons including [this](http://images.politico.com/global/2012/07/bbw_mormonempire_cover29.jpg) from the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek. For a little bit of background on this cover and what it is depicting. That is Joseph Smith who is the founder of the Mormon church along with another member of the church receiving a blessing from an angel.  Obviously this angel did not say those things that are on the cover and disputing what the cover brings up is a topic for a different subreddit, so please don't address those things, but know that this cover is offensive to most Mormons. This scene in Mormon theology is as sacred as Moses receiving the ten commandments or Buddha reaching Nirvana. 

So I guess I'm just trying to understand why its acceptable to harshly mock some religions (not just Mormons) but not others.

TL;DR Why is it politically correct to never criticize one religion but its okay to criticize another?



Edit: /u/nosotros_road_sodium explained it the best with the [Punch UP vs Punch Down idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/35md5x/cmv_mainstream_acceptance_of_the_book_of_mormon/cr5qlbl).  Thanks a bunch from all of your input guys it was very informative and helpful. And thank you for not being rude to me for being Mormon.

Mocking a majority religion like Christianity is degrees edgier than mocking a minority religion like Islam. Yes, I know a minority of Christians are LDS, but Mormons have become a cultural force in America whether: a major university with a powerhouse football program (BYU), the last Republican presidential candidate (Mitt Romney), and the numerous Mormons in business executive positions (Marriott for instance, from what I recall). 

Muslims, on the other hand, get lots of shit for choosing their faith, with the stereotype of being terrorists/terrorist apologists/anti-American rising post 9/11. look at how many ""Obama is a covert Muslim"" remarks have been spread around AM radio, blogs, Free Republic, etc. since Obama entered the national political scene. The ""All-American Muslim"" reality show, an attempt to show how Muslims are ""just as American"" as WASPs, backfired big time, while the same audiences offended by such a show embrace reality TV about fundamentalist Christianity like ""19 Kids and Counting"".

TL;DR: Mocking a majority religion = standing up to a bully, mocking a minority religion = kicking a dead man.","I'm going to take a guess here and say it has something to do with how mature the culture is that follows the religion.

Mormons, from what I've seen, are mature people who, if you say something dumb about their religion to them, will rather ignore you for being dumb then take actual offence by it. One can talk and discuss religion in general with them without the feeling they are talking to either a wall or a broken record.

A lot of Christians I know are similar, you can mock their faith all you want, they understand that different people hold different views and not everybody believes as they do and it's fine. Joke about the religion and they laugh, say something dumb about it and they ignore you.

Yet other Christians I've met or heard about seem to want to grab arms as soon as a non-believer even mentions god. Or treat you as if you're denying the day and night cycle.

Most people I know that follow the Islam are different than that, the ""mature"" people will simply not like it when you joke about the religion and give you very foul looks if you say something dumb about it. The not-so-mature folks will take greater offence.

In the end, the reason why I think it's okay to joke about some religions and not others is because some religions have a lot of supporters that get really pissed if you joke about their religion.

As for how it should be, or rather, how I think it should be, acceptance for people saying dumb shit should be lower.

"The likes of /r/atheism argue that most of the world's problems come from religion, and that a post-religion world would be miles better.

As humans, we inherently drive ourselves into groups based on similarities. Sometimes, these groups bunch up against each other. Eventually, the groups will want to expand over the same area. Each group thinks that they are the sole group worthy of that land, and that they must display this worthiness by stopping anyone that gets into their way. 

You could replace the word ""group"" with anything: religion, race, color, etc. Sure, religion's the largest group, but if religion were to disappear any day, there would still be sectarian fighting. You'd hear news about conflicts between the ""Arab Nationalist Front"" and the ""Pashtun Defense Brigade"" instead of ISIS that could be just as violent as religious conflict. 

TL;DR: If humans weren't killing each other over religion, they'd be killing each other over ethnicity or race. ","You have said that eliminating religion wouldn't eliminate sectarian violence, and of course it wouldn't. That kind of violence will always exist, and anyone who tells you otherwise is speaking with a mind full of utopia. That being said, just because something isn't the only factor playing a part in violence doesn't mean it plays no part at all. Nationalism, racism, religion - when taken to their furthest implications - will almost always result in some kind of fanaticism, which is exactly why religion **does** play a vital role in the amount of violence we see today.

Religion is unique in the sense that it can provide someone the promise of post-life reward. Someone active in the military may be fighting for the idea of securing their family's safety, or the safety of their country, yes, but even that army can't promise that soldier an **eternal** benefit for their contribution. Religions, on the other hand, often promise that very thing.

The answer is that many religious ideologies either promise an eternal reward **for** doing it (i.e. heaven), or an eternal punishment for **not** doing it (hellfire and the like).

Sure, one could chalk all of this up as certain people using religion as an excuse to make others ""do their dirty work."" Even I once believed that every time religious violence showed up on the news, that it was only a bad apple or two, and that the religion itself played no part in it happening. But eventually I had to face the terrifying truth in front of our faces today; in pretty much every holy book there are callings for true believers to wreak havoc on those who don't believe. While Islam is the most often accused of [breeding fanatics](http://www.vexen.co.uk/religion/islam_unbelievers.html), it's worthy of noting that [the Bible also calls upon true Christians to shed blood.](http://www.humanreligions.info/violence_and_crime.html#Christianity) In Matthew 10:34, Jesus Christ of Nazareth himself said that he came to earth, [""not to send peace, but a sword.""](http://www.holybooks.info/matthew.html#Chapter10) Hell, even [Buddhist and Hindu scriptures](http://www.humanreligions.info/violence_and_crime.html#Scriptures) contain justifications for murder.

There are a handful of ideas so gripping, so compelling that someone would be willing to die for them. Sometimes their influence is so strong that they won't stop at killing themselves, sometimes it's so strong that killing other people isn't off the table, either. Sadly, religion falls into this category. It all comes down to interpretation of a religion's core principles, the way its followers interpret its holy book(s). And while it is true that a majority of any of these religions will condemn the ones murdering, there are noticeable communities within these faiths that are willing to kill in the name of the faith. Getting rid of religion wouldn't eliminate all crime, but it would be childish to say that, with all of these dogmas done away with, there wouldn't be **any** noticeable difference in violence around the world.

**EDIT:** While I don't think I strayed from being as objective and unbiased as possible, some seem to have taken my comment as an antireligious sentiment. This is false. I support the practice of all religion and believe it plays a huge part in cultures and the growth of communities around the world. The purpose of the comment is to change OP's view (which is the point of this subreddit, IIRC) that violence in a world without religion would be in no way, shape or form different than violence in a world with religion. It in no way calls for the abolishment of religion, which is something I would disagree with personally.

**EDIT #2:** Something that's interesting to me is that some of you have criticized what you perceive to be bias against Christianity, or Hinduism or Buddhism, in the sources I provided. However, the claims against Islam leading to violence have simply been left alone. This leaves a question in my mind: if Islam alone was done away with, would violence in the world be any different at all? I think we'd all agree it would. And if you said yes, then wouldn't it, by definition, be different if religion as a whole was gone?","Let's imagine a hypothetical. There is a religion based on a holy book that is only one sentence long: ""If you kill someone above the height of 6' you will go to paradise"" Now imagine that this is one of the most widely believed religions in the world.



It's easy to imagine how the existance of this religion could make the world more violent. As a person above 6' tall I would certainly look over my shoulder more often. It would also be fair to assume that violence against tall people would increase. Would some people who were prone to violence anyway use this as an outlet? Certainly. Would the organization into this religion cause groups to form which would otherwise form anyway under nationalism? Probably. But all it takes is one person who would be otherwise a normal and peaceful person, in full belief that killing a person about 6' would send him to paradise, in order to make it a more violent world. Can you imagine a person, with complete and utter confidence in this doctrine, who would be motivated to kill? If it truly were one of the most popular in the world you can expect the number of people who are motivated by this religion alone to kill someone above 6' to be massive. However, even if only say 10,000 believed it you could still expect it to be a more violent world, as some amount of those 10,000 would be motivated to kill. So I think we can agree that a world in which this religion were believed in any capacity would be more violent than the one we live in now.



This hypothetical is a direct parallel to the world we live in with regards to Islam. Within the doctrine of Islam lies the idea that if you martyr yourself killing infidels, you will be rewarded in paradise. The only difference is that Islam is a much more convoluted religion with many interpretations, some of which repudiating martyrdom. Yet sects of Islam for which Martyrdom is a prominent feature do exist, and in no small number, and a significant amount of these believers have enacted and are enacting suicide attacks. Even if radical versions of Islam are not immensely popular (though they are far more popular than most people suppose), by the same logic that we concluded that the belief in the hypothetical religion in any capacity makes the world more violent can also be applied to radical Islam. It is not a difference of kind, it is a difference of scale. If any number of people, however small, believe that blowing themselves up in a crowded area will get them into paradise, religion directly causes the world to be more violent.



While you may think that the number of radical Islamists is negligible, you must concede that it is a difference in scale only.

Sure they'll have a few go-to facts or stats that are essentially cherry picked to support their view, or they may even be aware of the news, etc,(again to find info to support their position) but new evidence rarely changes people's minds.

If people did have beliefs based on evidence there'd be a greater diversity in the beliefs individuals held. As it is, if I know a person cares about climate change, odds are they are anti-gun rights and pro-choice. If they're big on border protection, they're gonna be small government and pro-gun rights. These are largely unrelated topics, yet at least 80% of the time people hold these 'suites' of ideas.

People seldom shift on these big issues, because views aren't evidence based, they're ideological. The few times people do change its because of one of two reasons.

An overall change in societal norms on the issue. Same sex marriage is a good example of this. This wasn't even on the agenda 20 years ago. There has been little 'data' to change peoples minds; we've just had a kind of cultural shift, and now its broadly accepted. It wasn't data or evidence that changed people's minds, it was a change in societies norms.

The other thing which I believe *can* change folks' minds is personal experience/change. I've known people to retire, or have  a health crisis, which shakes up their whole outlook, including views on ''the big issues. Or perhaps a personal brush with an issue-""My son came out, now I'm pro-same sex marriage""

So persuade me people are actually rational, and can be convinced by actual facts-CMV

[EDIT]:  To clarify I mean objective evidence(data, stats, facts), as opposed to emotive appeal(personal anecdotes/experience.  I'm sure there's some grey area, but that's the general idea)

[""evidence"" in this context means objective stats or data, and doesn't include personal experience, or one emotionally affecting news event(e.g ""Sandy Hook really got to me, now I'm anti-guns"") ]","Are your set of ""big issues"" specifically ""issues that are controversial/unresolved in 2015"", and your set of evidence specifically ""evidence that is available in 2015""?  Because if so, you might imagine that the reason the issue is unresolved is because the fact pattern can be interpreted at least two ways.

How about some previous large issues?  

*Evolution  (evidence resolved via science)

*Empiricism vs innate knowledge (evidence resolved via science)

*Heliocentric astronomy (evidence resolved via science)

*Prohibition (evidence resolved via a grand societal experiment)

I would disagree with your characterization of same sex marriage attitudes.  What happened was that the gay community made a conscious effort to encourage one another to ""come out"".  People suddenly had many more data points, and were thus able to generalize from something approximating [actual set of gay people] instead of from the very-skewed sample they'd previously known about.  They hadn't previously known that gay people were so normal because the normal gay people were mostly closeted.


","This varies a lot based on what type of issue you are talking about.

I'm surprised you used climate change to support your view - to me climate change is a clear example of evidence *clearly* driving people's views.  The climate change ""debate"" is politicians arguing over science, but the issue itself is a matter of scientists, and among credible scientists there isn't really a ""debate"" because the evidence all points solidly in one direction.  The arguments against climate change come largely from corporate interests and the politicians and ""scientists"" bought by corporate interests.  In other words, the scientific community largely agrees (based on the evidence) that climate change is a major challenge, and some politicians (who are not experts in climate science) have accused the entire scientific community of pulling some sort of scheme.  One side is motivated by desire to uncover the truth through experimentation and research (scientists) and the other is motivated by money from sponsors (politicians).

Edit 2: I do see now that Chrome is still innovating, but not so much on the aesthetics, but rather helping developers and making better websites. Also, after reading most a lot of comments (thank you for that), I see now that Chrome is more than a browser but rather a platform. It offers a wide range of features (Hangouts, Sync, etc) that no other browser can match at the moment.

You may not think Chrome looks good, but others would say that it does. It really comes down to personal taste.

You also have to give Chrome a lot of credit for pushing the state-of-the-art in Web and Web browser development. Before Chrome came out in 2008, the Web was an incredibly difficult platform to develop on. A majority of the Web's users used various forms of Internet Explorer, with a much smaller population using Firefox. And even as far as browser design was considered, it was All Toolbars, All The Time (modeled after IE6).

Chrome really shook up browser design, in a very big way. With tabs in the window header, people had a LOT more vertical viewing room, which made browsing the Web better. Along with browsing, having better support for new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features allowed developers to build beautiful, performant websites without using external plugins (like Flash and Java). This gave way to Responsive Web Design, allowing pages to look good no matter what device the user is browsing with.

Finally, on the subject of memory use, Chrome is a hog for a reason: security. Chrome was the first browser to have Tab Sandboxing, which means that each browser tab spawns its own operating system process. Should the tab crash for some reason (Flash fails to load, page can't be reached on the server, etc), it won't bring down the entire browser. Also, code running in one tab can't access the data in another tab; they're accessing entirely different sections of memory. That all comes at a cost, however: with more tabs open and more processes running, more memory is being used. That's less of a concern now since users are commonly using machines with 4+ GB of RAM, but it can still bog down the rest of the machine since the OS has to page memory in and out of disk swap (but now I'm getting far too technical). Extensions as well also operate in their own process, so the more extensions you have installed, the more memory you're using.

As I said in the first paragraph, I don't expect this explanation will change your mind. However, it's important to know the design decisions the Chrome dev team made, and how it impacted the rest of the Web. Most other browsers look/operate like Chrome because Chrome pioneered a far superior way of doing things, and other browser vendors followed suit. I've only scratched the surface of what Chrome has done (their v8 JavaScript VM, WebRTC, SPDY/HTTP 2.0, rapid development cycle, WebM, etc etc etc). Point being, Chrome is very much on the forefront of Web and browser development. Google employs a LOT of brilliant people to work on this product, and it shows. Just because the browser's design has stabilized isn't a sign that it's slowing down; rather it's a sign that others are catching up.","One thing that seems outright ignored here:

&gt; Saying that you use Chrome means nothing anymore, and might as well use IE (or the incarnation Spartan)

If you mean it's unremarkable because Chrome is so popular, is that a bad thing? Plus, Chrome is mostly Chromium, which is open source. There is no version of IE which can say that, and if IE and Chrome were in all other ways equal, I'd choose the one that's more open.

&gt; Edit: Also the memory usage by Chrome is crazy. I can't comment on the memory usage by Firefox haven't used it that much

I agree that Chrome needs to improve memory usage, but I don't think you're doing a fair comparison. Not entirely your fault, because it's *hard* to do a fair comparison. You'd basically need to import all your bookmarks and history and such back into Firefox, find Firefox equivalents for all your Chrome extensions, open the same webpages in the same order, and so on...

Even then, you'd need to use Chrome's task manager to measure how much memory it's using, because the Windows Task Manager (or the OS X Activity Monitor, or just 'top 'on Linux) often massively overestimates it. Like the top poster says, Chrome has this multiprocess model. Those processes still share a lot of memory, so the OS is double-counting that. (Or triple, or quadruple...)

At the end of the day, I think Firefox still wins. But it's not as insane a difference as people think. I think probably half the reason people think Chrome RAM is ridiculous is that it's the browser they're using.

That said, I agree with at least some of the sentiment here -- I miss the days when Chrome was so obviously faster than everything else that Google was [showing off like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCgQDjiotG0).

And yet, with *that* said:

&gt; To put it simply, other browsers has closed, if not overtaken the Chrome and everything it stood for.

To an extent, this is true. It certainly happened pretty quickly for JavaScript, for example -- everyone was using pretty naive JS *interpreters* back then, and Chrome was the first browser to do an actual JIT VM, compiling JS down to native code. It was like five to ten times faster than every other browser. Safari and IE closed that gap pretty quickly.

But I think this is most of what Chrome was meant for anyway. Why did Google make a browser? To push the Web forward. Sounds altruistic, but it's simpler than that -- they want things like Gmail to be fast. Most users used IE, and IE is slow, so Gmail was (relatively) slow for a lot of users.

I think it's fair to say that Chrome fixed that problem. Chrome made JS fast enough in Chrome to embarrass all the other browsers into making their own JS engines fast. So now Gmail is fast, even in IE. Even if 90% of users were still stuck on IE, that would be a win.

From that perspective, the fact that Chrome also has a lot of users is just a nice side effect. (And it's also insurance that Microsoft will never again do what they did with IE6.)",72,"One thing that seems outright ignored here:

"First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots.

I didn't feel it was appropriate to discuss the douchiness of it there so I decided to make this post.

You go into a parking lot and are trying to find a place to park. There's one 15 spots away from the door and then there's one that's 3 spots away from the door. One of them is meant for expectant mothers but there is no punishment for parking there if you are not an expectant mother which makes the two spots equivalent in everything expect for distance from the door. Objectively, it's better to choose the closer one.

"I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters.

I am not disputing the fact that the United States achieved its principal military/political goals (defeat of the Third Reich and the Japanese Empire), and I of course recognize the fact that the US managed to do so with virtually no civilian casualties/ destruction of the homeland, which is especially impressive given the sheer scale of civilian destruction seen in World War II.

What I am arguing is that, having 'won' (as much as it is possible to win) the war, the United States promptly lost its soul, and has ended up in a worse position than Germany or Japan. The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.

I think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on. It's a cycle that only leads to cartoonishly large military budgets and American blood spilled in conflicts where we don't belong. In short, hegemony has not been kind to the United States, and we would be better off if we weren't a world power.

Contrast this with the Japanese and Germans, who are (arguably) doing rather well for themselves. Sure, each country was broken and defeated at the end of the war, and it took a very long time for them to recover, but they came out better. I say they came out better because neither the Japanese nor Germany have the 'obligation' to police the world. In fact, both countries forbid themselves from taking offensive military action. While these countries can be (and often are) considered 'western', and are sometimes the target of anti-western hate, they are not widely hated like the United States, and are not tasked with maintaining ridiculous global military presence. Rather (and forgive me for oversimplifying), Germany can focus on Germany and Japan can focus on Japan. One need not look long to find a wealth of statistics to indicate that these two nations have far superior social safety nets, education, healthcare, etc. than the United States. While this superiority can, of course, be attributed to a wide variety of factors, I believe that one cannot ignore the important fact that these nations have their priorities straight, having suffered the shame of defeat, having gone through the experience of rebuilding and being free of any expectation of global military prowess.

What really solidifies this belief for me is the existence of universal health care in most of western Europe. I apologize that I don't have the source, but if I remember correctly, I remember watching an interview with a worker in the UK's NHS, who attributed the success of socialized medicine in Europe (versus the US) to the fact that Europe had to rebuild after World War II. Effectively, when you have to start from scratch and pick your life up from the rubble, there's a greater sense of common bond with the rest of your nation. The US, having not been hurt in the war in the same way, never had to rebuild and instead developed a more violently individualistic character, where the idea of potentially paying for someone else's health care is utterly repulsive. Americans, by virtue of having won World War II without civilian casualty, has ended up with a far worse society than those who 'lost'. If that's the case, aren't we the real losers?

Sorry if this post got long. Please, CMV!

But generally speaking, it's not really accurate to think that the cold war was considered a bad outcome from the US's strategic perspective. The perpetual war on terror is the new version of this: a supposedly existential threat that gives a politically expedient excuse for all kinds of measures of control.",r2,0.7,0.5,0.8,0.6,0.7,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.9,0.0,0.5,0.7,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.3,r1,,
"I think that people have a right to those artistic, cultural, and aesthetic forms that please them, and openly sharing and partaking of diverse ideas and styles makes the world a richer, more innovative, and better place. Saying that a particular style of dress, manner of speech, way of doing things, or cultural icon ""belongs"" to a particular group of people who have rights over who may use it and how is dogmatic and dictatorial. If a person wants to wear a kimono or headdress to imitate and mock Japanese people or Native Americans, that's obviously racist and offensive. But if someone wants to wear a kimono or headdress because they like the way they look, the usage of those forms is at worst benign and at best potentially a show of admiration for them and the cultures whence they come.","I think there are two separate issues here.  First is whether people have a right to appropriate art.  Second is whether there is a legitimate basis for offense from those whose art is appropriated.

I think the answer to the first is obviously that yes, you have a right to appropriate art.  Do what you want, wear what you want, and, as with anything, be aware that others will have reactions to what you do that you cannot control.  If you're fine with that, go ahead - you are a free person.  Anytime somebody tells you not to do something because it constitutes appropriation, you should assume that what they mean is ""I will be upset with you if you do this thing"" rather than ""you are not free to choose to do this thing"".

That is a separate question from whether those who feel their culture has been wrongfully appropriated have a legitimate grievance.  I think of appropriation as divorcing the artistic value of something from the cultural context in which it was created.  

An analogy that I like to use to illustrate this is  is the commercialization of Christmas - I'm sure there are many observant Christians who believe that Christmas traditions are intended to spring from a place of faith and reflection, and a belief that Christ is their savior. They probably see non-Christians (or non-observant Christians) as ""appropriating"" Christmas, in some regard, by tying it so closely to consumerism. Of course it is everybody's right to celebrate Christmas as they please, but I wouldn't begrudge a Christian for feeling like everyone else has ""ruined"" Christmas by taking it so far away from its spiritual roots.  Christians who strongly and genuinely object to the commercialization of Christmas are clearly a minority in the U.S., and therefore their perception of the meaning of Christmas is out-voted by the relatively-less-Godly majority, and they lose control of society's dominant interpretation and valuation of the holiday.

Other forms of cultural appropriation similarly divorce the entertainment value of certain art forms from the social context and life experiences that created it in the first place.  As a result, society sees that art and values it very differently from the intent of its creators, and depending on what those differences look like, it can be a perfectly understandable grievance that you as a potential appropriator are free to choose to concede to or ignore.  ","Ok.  

Let's put the shoe on the other foot.  Let's have Chinese Buddhists appropriate the dress of Roman Catholic priests.  And wear those robes to rock concerts.

How exactly do you feel watching people play with things that you consider absolutely sacred, given to you by Christ himself.  And people who don't understand it are using it as entertainment, pop culture, in general treating your religion as a joke to be mocked.

The point is that there are parts of any culture that are sacred.  Things that are never to be taken lightly by the culture or by outsiders without causing great offense.

- They are hypocritical: The mods would ban anyone who stated things they disagreed with. And yet they get upset when they are banned themselves.

- They are narrow-minded: Anyone who disagrees with them is assumed to be fat themselves. The idea that non-fat people could find what they say idiotic and lacking any value is completely foreign to them.

First off, the doses of even the best drugs tend to be very sensitive.  We have to estimate the weight of the animal and put the correct amount of the drug in the needle.  While a good drug can account by us being off by a bit, it does not account for the danger of using a dose for a creature twice the size or bigger.  As humans have a large range of potential body sizes, that means that the police would not be able to have the darts pre-loaded and ready to go, but rather have to load up a dart with the drug while in pursuit and estimating their size.  That changes the time between deciding to use the weapon and using it from a few seconds to a few minutes (if not longer), which can mean the difference between life and death in a situation where using either weapon is needed.

&gt;And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier?  They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?

A 250 lbs man holding a 100 lbs woman still means that if she gets a dart meant for him in her, she will likely die.

Secondly, even in a perfectly healthy subject, there is a great deal of possibility of complications.  These drugs work by relaxing the muscles and/or paralyzing them, but that also applies to muscles like the diaphragm and heart.  When sedating an animal, we have to closely monitor their breathing and temperature to make sure that the drug is not causing problems and potentially administer counter agents.

Third, many humans already have drugs in their system, both legal and illegal.  Without knowing exactly what they have in them, it is impossible to know how the tranquilizer will interact.  It may make it useless, it may make it deadly, it may drive them into a berserker rage.  Without their medical history in from of us and a pharmacist, we cannot know.

Fourth, tranquilizers take a while to take effect.  It sometimes takes as long as several minutes after the drugs enter their system for it to impact them.  With an animal, we can easily sit back and observe them from a distance until they collapse, but with a criminal it will just give him a few minutes of doing whatever dangerous activity he is already engaged in.  Some people may react to being hit by a dart with anger and become more violent.  Also, if they happen to know the drug the police use, they may have a syringe of a counter-agent with them and be able to use the time to nullify the effect.

Fifth, darts are far less accurate than a regular bullet.  Distance must be carefully estimated and applied to whatever launcher is used.  Overestimating distance means the dart will not hit with enough force and not penetrate skin or will drop too much and miss entirely.  Underestimating distance means the dart not dropping enough and overshooting the target or hitting and doing severe damage with the impact.  This means that the chances of the police hitting their target at all are very low, and they must engage from a much shorter distance.

Finally, the darts are very difficult to get to inject even when they hit the target.  Often times simply fur is enough to stop a successful hit from injecting the drug and cause it to simply spray the outside of the animal.  A heavy coat, leather jacket, or a wide range of other possible clothing options can easily do the same thing and prevent the drug from entering the system of the target even on an accurate shot.

Overall, if I am going up against gun bearing criminal with either a tranquilizer gun or a baseball bat, I will take the bat because I will be more likely to win and I will be less likely to kill the criminal in the event of a victory.","Have you ever seen an anesthesiologist's paycheck? They get paid a lot, and a huge portion of what they get paid goes straight to malpractice insurance.

A 250 lbs man holding a 100 lbs woman still means that if she gets a dart meant for him in her, she will likely die.

Secondly, even in a perfectly healthy subject, there is a great deal of possibility of complications.  These drugs work by relaxing the muscles and/or paralyzing them, but that also applies to muscles like the diaphragm and heart.  When sedating an animal, we have to closely monitor their breathing and temperature to make sure that the drug is not causing problems and potentially administer counter agents.

Third, many humans already have drugs in their system, both legal and illegal.  Without knowing exactly what they have in them, it is impossible to know how the tranquilizer will interact.  It may make it useless, it may make it deadly, it may drive them into a berserker rage.  Without their medical history in from of us and a pharmacist, we cannot know.

Fourth, tranquilizers take a while to take effect.  It sometimes takes as long as several minutes after the drugs enter their system for it to impact them.  With an animal, we can easily sit back and observe them from a distance until they collapse, but with a criminal it will just give him a few minutes of doing whatever dangerous activity he is already engaged in.  Some people may react to being hit by a dart with anger and become more violent.  Also, if they happen to know the drug the police use, they may have a syringe of a counter-agent with them and be able to use the time to nullify the effect.

Fifth, darts are far less accurate than a regular bullet.  Distance must be carefully estimated and applied to whatever launcher is used.  Overestimating distance means the dart will not hit with enough force and not penetrate skin or will drop too much and miss entirely.  Underestimating distance means the dart not dropping enough and overshooting the target or hitting and doing severe damage with the impact.  This means that the chances of the police hitting their target at all are very low, and they must engage from a much shorter distance.

Finally, the darts are very difficult to get to inject even when they hit the target.  Often times simply fur is enough to stop a successful hit from injecting the drug and cause it to simply spray the outside of the animal.  A heavy coat, leather jacket, or a wide range of other possible clothing options can easily do the same thing and prevent the drug from entering the system of the target even on an accurate shot.

Overall, if I am going up against gun bearing criminal with either a tranquilizer gun or a baseball bat, I will take the bat because I will be more likely to win and I will be less likely to kill the criminal in the event of a victory.",r2,0.7,0.5,0.8,0.6,0.5,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.2,0.9,0.7,0.6,0.0,0.9,0.0,0.9,0.5,0.3,r2,,
"Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, is it looked down on and dismissed as anecdotal evidence for someone to share an experience of theirs? I quite enjoy listening to anecdotal evidence to get new perspectives I wouldn't have thought of or haven't heard before.

I understand that in an anecdotal case it is not scientific because it cannot be replicated and held to control standards, but I don't think this is grounds for dismissing the case as merely anecdotal and not worth mentioning. Am I wrong about this?

There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking anecdotal evidence into consideration, especially in a circumstance like asking someone you know their experience and opinion regarding a product that you are considering buying. There is absolutely valuable information that can be taken from anecdotal evidence.

The problem is when you come to an actual conclusion based on anecdotal evidence alone. We cannot logically come to any conclusions on something based on one observation. There is nothing to say that the results obtained were not outliers, or that they cannot be explained by something other than what we are looking at.

So, you aren't wrong in saying that we should not dismiss something because of anecdotal evidence, but if we are hoping to form a well thought out opinion on something, we really should require more than anecdotal evidence alone.

Most importantly, it should not be used to dismiss evidence that has been gathered scientifically, through numerous observations. There are exceptions to every rule, and we can't go around denying established rules or truths because we know of an exception. Your high functioning meth smoking cousin does not disprove the idea that meth is a destructive drug.

"For the purpose of this post, I am defining ""capitalism"" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. ""Socialism"" is defined as a system in which the government owns the means of production, and distributes all things necessary for decent quality of life (food, water, shelter, education, health care, etc) for free to all minors and any adult either working, seeking work, or enrolled in school. I understand that this definition is more specific than the true definition of socialism, but I want to preempt any arguments suggesting that people won't look for work if everything is provided for them anyway; they won't be provided for unless they contribute. Also, please note that I am not advocating any specific system of governance; I don't want a debate about the merits of direct democracy. Assume that the system of governance is something effective and relatively democratic, unless there is a compelling reason why my definition of socialism ensures ineffective government.

With that out of the way, here is my justification. I believe that capitalism ensures exploitation of the lower-classes. The winners in a capitalist system are nearly always those who were born into relative wealth already. Even the rags-to-riches stories of our time, such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, they were all born into at least lower-middle class. Those trapped in poverty are normal people, who usually work much harder than the people at the top, and get nothing for it. I don't mean to put down high-ranking executives, or other wealthy individuals, but I think that if capitalism is designed to benefit those who work hard, it's doing a shoddy job. Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair.

And that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.

Not only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a ""Green!"" or ""Eco-Friendly"" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot). 

So, with those reasons put out for why capitalism is bad, here's why I think socialism is better. Socialism prevents needless death and suffering by ensuring that everyone who contributes gets everything they need for a healthy life. Socialism ends cyclical poverty by giving everyone a chance at education, without worries about putting food on the table. Socialism is better for rewarding the hard-workers and punishing the slackers, because without unfair head starts going to rich kids entering the workforce, the real cream will rise to the top (there would be variable wages and such; the government employers could offer raises and promotions to their best workers). Socialism is better for the environment, because the government could have direct control, and would have much more incentive to manage the environment in sustainable ways than short-term-minded corporations.

I guess I can go further in depth in my replies, if needed. I'm looking for a good debate, and maybe a change of heart. Change my view!

EDIT: OK all, so I have been persuaded by a combination of factors that socialism as I define it is not as good as capitalism with generous welfare policies and heavy regulations (think Nordic model). I'll be giving out deltas now. I will continue debating as well, but I think I'm done for now. I will resume later.

That sounds great in principle, but how do you determine whether someone deserves government support? There are so many loop-holes that closing all of them is nearly impossible without imposing unreasonable regulations on what is an acceptable life-style. 

I could easily enroll in a low-tier community college, pick low-work major, sign up for the minimum hours to be a full-time student, and pass all my classes without attending them and with no more than an hour or two or work a week. I could probably do this for 8 years before I graduated. Meanwhile, I could sit and browse reddit all day. Should I be getting all your socialist benefits?

Alternatively, suppose I want to go into some exotic profession like streaming video games. There are hundreds of people out there that end up making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year by streaming because they have built up a viewer-base of tens of thousands of people. But to get that viewerbase, you need to constantly be producing content, and the process of acquiring viewers is very slow and it took ages for many of the popular streamers to get above a dozen people tuning in. How do you differentiate between someone who sits and plays video games all day verses the next pro-gamer that will entertain a hundred thousand viewers a day?

What if I want to go out and make the new app that sells millions of copies? How long can I come out with unsuccessful flappy-birds until your system stops supporting me?

And about that person seeking work... they have a nice resume, went and got themselves a good degree, have some experience, but no one is hiring them. Their personality is simply terrible and no one wants to work with them. Then what? 

I do not believe that socialism is fundamentally wrong, but you can't just provide everyone's basic needs if they are ""productive members of society"" without some serious problems arising. 

People are very much inherently lazy and many already do the minimum they need to not get fired. When you give them a socialist safety blanket, they will continue to do the minimum they need to keep it. If you want to advocate such an extreme form of socialism (what you suggested is much more extreme than what any socialist country right now has), your system is doomed to fail until you find some way of closing pretty much every loophole of how you trick the system. How do you hope to do that?","*Note: I don't have a lot of information on your whole post, but on the economics side.

"As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one:

**They reduce the extent of any injuries caused by a bike accident**

Bike helmets are proven to make any injuries obtained greatly decreased. The effectiveness of helmets are found to be 85-88% in preventing serious injury. About 70-80% of accidents involve some damage to the head. It is estimated that if children ages 5-15 were forced to wear a helmet, 39,000 to 45,000 head injuries would be avoided, along with 18,000-55,000 face and scalp injuries. I could go on and on with these, but I don't have that much time. If you want more proof, just google ""bike helmet facts"". I've also listed my sources below. 

Sources: 

http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/ped_bike/docs/b_helmetlaws.pdf

https://sites.google.com/site/bicyclehelmetmythsandfacts/ (NSFW, for some reason there is a picture of a man and woman riding naked. Still good stuff on this page, though)

**Helmets do not interfere with riding the bike.**

Helmets, if they are the correct size, do not get in the way while riding the bike. The only thing they can do is possibly disturb the airflow, but special aerodynamic helmets are made for this, if that is that big of a deal to a person. 

Common Counterarguments:

**It messes up my hair!/It is uncomfortable!/It makes me look like a dork!**

I always hear this, but, you know what, none of these are that big of a deal! I would much rather endure a little discomfort than get a possibly permanent injury to my head.

**But I haven't fallen off my bike in, like, years!**

This one. I hate when people say this. Just because you haven't gotten in a crash in a while does not mean that you are exempt from ever crashing again. This is especially true when travelling on a main road when other cars are a factor.

**They're so expensive!!**

No, just no. An average bike helmet will cost about 10 bucks or less. If you can afford a bike, then you can afford a helmet

Alright, that's it for now. Please CMV!

I don't think I'm of the party that has difficulty understanding consent. I also understand that there may be a great deal of fear for some women that they may be raped, and I don't wish to sound as though I'm downplaying that. But I have a fear myself of being falsely accused, or accused in a case where consent is retroactively removed. I don't think of this potential as being very high; I don't think most women are that vindictive; however in the event that it occurs it seems the results can be devastating. I've personally spoken to someone who has gone through this process and it took him almost a year to clear his name. 

I don't want this fear; I'm very open to the idea that it may be exaggerated in the media I've read, or that there are faults in my reasoning. But these are potentials and I can't seem to confirm them on my own; maybe someone else can poke some holes.

I believe the only difference between a romantic relationship and a friendship/platonic relationship is physical attraction.  Lots of people talk of love or some mystical force, but in reality people make all sorts of concessions with regard to a person's character flaws and personality, but no one I have met is willing to compromise in terms of a desire to get nekkid with the person of their dreams.  There are other factors that come into play with regard to the interaction lasting or being fulfilling, but I do believe that the only fundamental difference between these two types of interactions is the sexual element.  Change my view.

&gt;I believe the only difference between a romantic relationship and a friendship/platonic relationship is physical attraction.

And it's not going to be about mystical forces or destiny or any such nonsense. It's going to be about my own crude understanding of modern neuroscience. 

The part you're missing in the above description is that romantic love also has two other key components in most tests, which I'll call **prioritization** and **interconnection**.

I'll start with the latter because it's harder to catch, but easier to visualize: **Interconnection** is how much your thoughts about X are connected to other thoughts. In simplified terms, whenever you think of ""Ice Cream"", your neurons will also send signals to other nearby concepts, such as the taste associated with ice cream, memories related to ice cream, images, coldness, and so on, and this propagates through a network of concepts and memories in your brain. 

With a normal person that you spend a lot of time with, that ""person"" in your mind is actually a lot of different concepts and nodes that connect to a lot of other things, and their name and face are only small parts of that. When you think about that girl Lorraine the Model, you're more likely to trigger the neurons in your brain related to the color pink because you know she likes pink, and she often wears it, so the connections between the nodes that contain your mental model of Lorraine are more closely connected with the nodes that fire off when you think of the color pink, than if you were to think about George the Office Guy. 

With someone that you're starting to get romantically attracted to, beyond the simple physical lust/attraction, it's frequently observed that you'll also start... ""enlarging"" the network of connections from that person-concept to other concepts and memories in your brain, so that ""they"" connect to more things in your mind... and more other things in your mind connect to ""them"". 

To visualize this, look at [this graph here](http://nickpegg.com/media/img/more_fun_with_graphs/nys-super-sanitized.png) and imagine this graph represents concepts in your mind. Green are clear concepts (""walking"", ""ice cream"", etc.), beige are specific memory data, and yellow are persons. Naturally this image isn't actually about neurons in brains, but it serves for this illustration. Notice the one yellow node that is so much more connected than the other yellow nodes? How it has many more memory/experience connections, but also due to its larger share of space is connected to more green concepts as well? 

That's the person you're getting romantically attracted to. 

**Prioritization** is simpler. It's when some concept in your mind has more affect associated with it, and thus holds higher *value*. It's frequently observed in tests that subjects will pay a higher cost to protect their SO / subject of romantic love than would be explained by the simple combination of platonic relationship and physical attraction. It's also harder to visualize, because it's not a linear number that you can just add up... letting that person cry for a few hours alone is still less negatively valued than letting your brother die, for instance. However, to take the graph analogy above, when a moral or hedonistic calculation goes through the nodes for this person, the resulting choice will weigh more heavily in that direction if the subject was one you were romantically attracted to than if the subject were only someone you were lusting for and had a platonic relationship with. 

In other words, it also depends on how much space they occupy in your mental map (measured by how often thinking about something else makes you also think about them) and how much emotion is generated when they are involved (measured by how long you spend crying if they tell you you're stupid vs someone else tells you you're stupid... or preferably some other, less painful method). Not just how much you interact with them, how much you trust them or how much you want to fuck them. ","There's a lot we don't understand about love, so I'm only speaking from personal experience when I say that I feel romantic attraction is different from platonic/sexual attraction. I have very good female friends with whom I love spending time and whom I find very attractive, but I'm for some reason not romantically attracted to them. It's a weird gut feeling when I am eventually romantically attracted to someone that's not really describable but goes beyond standard platonic and sexual desires. I'd describe romantic attraction as different from sexual attraction, even - my last crush was someone with whom I guess I would have slept had the opportunity arisen but for whom I fell because of non-sexual things (mostly because I felt really, really comfortable with her). I would describe my attraction to her less as ""I wanted to sleep with her"" and more ""I wanted to cuddle with her and talk.""

"There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives  and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, others claim that increased government spending (while keeping taxation the same) simulates the economy, but there is no consensus on this point, among economists or politicians. Deficit spending stimulates the economy, but we are already deficit spending, and the national debt is already rather large, so we can't do that forever. Low interest rates stimulate the economy, but elected officials have no direct influence over interest rates -- the Federal Reserve Board does that, and interest rates are already very, very low. New export markets also help, but the U.S. is already committed to several ambitious international trade agreements. Investor confidence helps, a little, maybe, sometimes, but the U.S. stock market is already overpriced. Beyond that, most economic growth comes from increases in productivity, and consumer confidence. Elected officials have no control over these.

If you vote for a candidate who promises to ""create jobs"" or ""grow the economy,"" you're either voting for a liar or a fool. Change my view!

Edit: I'm speaking of the U.S. economy, not the global economy, and I'm speaking of political candidates who might run for office in the near future, not the distant future or the past.

To re up your lease, they expect another large down payment *for a car you already have*. Their are milage restrictions. 
Once I knew a guy who lived in Detroit and wanted to go to Chicago for the weekend, but was afraid to drive his car because he calculated that his daily commute was going to put him very close to or slightly beyond the mileage limit by lease end. 
You're paying monthly for a car that you can't drive whenever you want because they're going to charge you $.25 per mile over the limit. If you go 3000 miles over (which could happen in one road trip) that's $750 you have to pay *just to give the car back*.  Oh and you're also paying through the nose for any dent, ding, bump, stain or scratch in the car. 



Unless it's a company providing a company car for business purposes. Your employer isn't in the business of owning, servicing and managing vehicles for the long term so a lease makes sense for them. They dont have time to sell a car when they're done with it, or deal with ownership. All the drawbacks of leasing such as mileage fees, they probably just pass that on to employee driving it.

"Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 

1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit whiny, perhaps because is is too close to ""why.""

2. Exclusivity. Only about 300 words in English start with X. Y starts over 700 (per Wolfram-Alpha, and this appears to include proper nouns). X appears in only 0.15% of English words, while Y appears in far more. I could not find an estimated percentage, but so many adverbs end in ""ly"" that it rather proves my point. Even though it's so exclusive, it is so much more versatile, as shown below.

3. Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind. 

4. Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4). 

5. Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable. 

6. Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze. 

7. Sex. Our favorite word not only has X right in it, but the whole last 2/3 of the word sounds like saying X. Y? Nowhere to be found, unless it tags along to make something sexy. Not to mention the uses of XXX, and the fact that fairer sex is made up of X chromosomes. Y gives us baldness, hairy backs, and emotional immaturity. 

8. History. Malcolm X, not Malcolm Y. There's even ""American History X.""

9. Versatility in other areas. X can be used to show that something is crossed out, used as a check mark to indicate the choice on a form, used in cartoons to show that a person is dead, used in medicine (x-rays), used to show treasure on a map, 

10. = X. 

11. ~~No one has ever died in a state spelled with an X. Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, and Wyoming combine for 10% of the deaths in the US each year~~ I somehow came up with the 4 Y states off the top of my head and also thought there were no X states. New Mexico and Texas. 

12. If you're talking about unknown items, you always say ""X is better than Y,"" never ""Y is better than X"". 


EDIT: It worked. I was forced to rethink some of my strongest points. I still may think that X is better, but I can see that Y has its merits and can sometimes be even superior. Very clever responses in many cases, and I'm afraid I'll be banned for giving out too many deltas to people who make me rethink each point.

X has a harsher pronunciation, a quality not usually considered good. Consider languages that have harsher tones, such as German and Russian. Conversely, languages with the more fluid tones that Y has, such as French and Italian, are considered more beautiful.  

2, Utility. The purpose of language, and its constituent letters, is to be used and to be useful. A letter that can be used more often is better than a letter that cannot. Y is used in adverbs. It enables us to act with nuance. X is typically used to describe things that used to be (ex-girlfriend, for example), and keeps us locked in the past.  

3, Flexibility. While X must always be a consonant, Y is able to flexibly switch between vowel and consonant. Indeed, it is the only letter able to do so. This unique power really grants Y super-letter status. Perhaps it has other powers, such as flight, and shooting lasers out of its top two prongs.  

4, Scrabble. Here's the thing about Y: it's a get out of jail free card. Let's say you're stuck and you just can't think of a word with the letters you have. Instead of skipping a turn or taking whatever punishment scrabble has, if you have a Y, you can just pop that onto the end of so many other words. Sexy, smokey, many. The list goes on. You can't quite do that as well with X. Sexx? Smokex? Manx? Well, I guess Manx works. But still. Y is better at the job.  

5, X in Algebra. X is the first letter learned in algebra, sure. But this is because X is mysterious and untrustworthy. Some days, X is 5. Other days, X is 10. Who are you, X?! And who are the members of your Axis of Evil?!  

6, Pleasing appearance. This is one of taste, so I don't think I can change your view on this. However, perhaps you would accept a different viewpoint. The Y displays the pleasing triangle shape that women like to see in fit men. Y has a strong chest and a thin waist. Presumably, under a magnifying glass, we would be able to see Y's six-pack abs.

"     Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. I can't believe rappers are allowed to win grammies and different music awards. Poets should be allowed to win grammies too then. Rap to me is like in the same category as a terrible singer sometimes. 

     Every person on this earth that can speak is capable of rapping. You can't say the same for singers, that can sing on key. You might say, it takes skill to rap well. No it doesn't. It takes time, and a pen and paper. It can be mastered relatively easy. Please show me why they deserve to be respected as musicians.

Edit 1: Okay u/scottevil110 pointed out to me, performing, or the entertainment value is a big part of a rappers act. It takes tremendous confidence and talent to get on stage and move a crowd with your lyrics. Some rappers are capable of this so, i changed my view that some have talent in that regard, but as far as the actual rapping i still believe that i could truthfully be the next Meek, or Young Thug.

Edit 2: Let me clarify what talent is to me. I already know what the webster definition is, the natural ability or aptitude to do something. Let's take young thug as an example and Lamarr. They're both rappers and make good music i like. Everyone who can talk has the ability to come up with the words young thug says, and say it like him in a drunken stupor. So everyone is talented then in some way. Lamar it would take longer, and he has a nice flow, but still it could be easily copied. Now, REAL talent to me, is a perormance like Keyshia Cole singing [Love](  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KTkW636B8xg) one of the greatest songs of all time. Or Peter Green ripping the shit out of a guitar, in songs like, need your love so bad, or [the supernatural](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YoasUjXBkm8_____). That's REAL talent, compared to something like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RAzzv6Ks9nc). REAL talent is something that not your average jor could do. Some are born with it. For some it takes years to become good at it, but it has to have a level of difficulty, in my view, that the average person can't easily attain.

Edit 3: u/glory2hypnotoad showed me writing a full length album on Eminems level does take i guess some real skill. So there are a few rappers who have some real talent. But generally they are untalented. However every singer that can sing on key is talented to me. It's just in a whole 'nother caliber of music to me, for the simple reason it's next to impossible to attain. Comparing Eminem to any singer that can sing on key, is like comparing Iman Shumpert to Lebron James.

&gt;Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat.

This seems to be pretty much your entire argument, essentially.

Most good rappers put in effort to how they say the words to make it compliment the beat and convey a message. I'm gonna be cliche and user Kendrick Lamar for most of my examples, just because he's one of the most vocally diverse rappers.

[In this song, he elongates his words and uses a raspy voice to make it sound like he's wailing, since it's a heart-wrenching part of the album](https://youtu.be/e5Ri76UodWM?t=2m23s)

[In this song, he changes his pitch to sound more like an adolescent](https://youtu.be/10yrPDf92hY?t=24s)

Those were some extreme examples, but there's also more subtle ones that are still very important

[In this song, he uses a deeper pitch than usually to give off braggadccio/cocky vibes, since he's meant to be freestyling in the car with his friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rckbxdHZTlI)

[In contrast, this song uses a more relaxed tone since he's 'made it' at this point in the album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF8aaTu2kg0)

All of this are important changes to his voice that are difficult to do in the first place, and even harder to do while simultaneously staying on beat and not sounding too forced.

&gt;Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever

Then that individual would be a bad rapper. A lot of other genres have untalented artists, too.

&gt;I can't believe rappers are allowed to win grammies and different music awards. Poets should be allowed to win grammies too then.

No, because poetry doesn't have a musical element. Almost any song is poetic if you just look at the lyrics, but there are other musical considerations that change how a rap song sounds.

"To me, online entertainment is such a flip of a coin. You either get a partnership or you don't, and even if you do get the partnership, there's no saying that what you make will be enough to live off of, so it's probably just safer to get a real job.

For Youtube, it seems like you need to be the following to be successful:

* A young attractive person (or at least a person with an attractive voice) that appeals to some major demographic (teenage girls, LGBT teens, sports fans, etc.)

* Someone who was already famous on a different social medium

* A Let's Player

And in all of these, you need a certain budget to spend on making your videos (light, camera, a crew maybe?) and that's not including the money you need for specific videos (e.g. a Let's Player needs enough money to buy new/big budget games in order to attract attention, a make-up channel needs to buy TONS of products, clothing channels need to shop on a regular basis, etc.).

Twitch has the same problems as a Youtube Let's Player; in order to be noticed, you need to buy really popular games and/or new games, and those are rarely cheap; most games are up in the $60+ range, not including DLC or even the equipment needed to stream at a constant frame-rate for long periods of time. 

Even if you DO get popular on either of these platforms and get a partnership, Twitch takes half of your subscription profits, leaving you mostly depending on possible donations, and Youtube takes a lot of your ad revenue (not including other Youtube-related partnerships you might have [cough cough Nintendo cough]). 

If you ABSOLUTELY need to make money on one of these platforms, or a similar platform, then you should either be rich or have had a real job long enough that you have enough money to survive.

"First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are devoted to saving the panda because pandas are extremely well known and popular, not because they have a good chance of survival.   Here are the reasons I believe this:
  
1) Pandas have lost much of their natural habitat due to the population explosion in China.  While this is regrettable, it is not likely to get fixed anytime soon. This means that even if we are able to revive this species they won't have anywhere to live.   
  
2) pandas, as a species, have chosen poorly. They are carnivorous animals who's main diet is bamboo. Their digestion can only process about 5% of the stuff in bamboo. That means they have to eat huge amounts of bamboo everyday. With the reduced habitat this is getting harder and harder. Either they need some microevolutionary shift to eat more nutritious sources of food orthey should join the likes of the dodo bird.   
  
3) human efforts to revive the population have shown some increases, but at what cost? It is incredibly difficult to get pandas to mate with one another, it's like they don't even want their species to survive. I get they aren't actually making this choice, this is just a facetious way of saying that their instincts and biology do not support the kind of growth in population hey need. Hell, half of their births are twins and the mother almost always lets one die because she doesn't produce enough milk. I realize this would take evolution to fix and this problem is way too short term, but it means that their survival requires an exorbanant amount of human intervention. Since their is a finite amount of resources conservationists can dedicate to endangered resources they are killing other more likely to survive species.  
  
4) I'm not saying we should encourage the decline of the panda. We should still try to preserve what habitat they have left and ban hunting them, but they are so far gone and require so much help that we shouldnt waste too many resources on them. Let the panda try to support a small and natural population without our interference. If they cannot achieve this goal, I don't think it's worth the resources to help them grow.","The WWF wants to promote biodiversity in a variety of things other than Pandas. However, average people who are interested in donating tend to care disproportionately more about pandas and other cute animals. Supporters may donate solely on an emotional desire to keep the pandas alive (in the face of the points outlined in your OP), but that doesn't mean the the WWF can't allocate the funds to less sexy, harder to advertise causes that might not attract the same financial support. That's to say that in addition to the intrinsic social and environmental value of saving pandas, the WWF can do more good across the board with the money that is donated with the pandas in mind.","I don't think it's a waste of money. In short, we conserve pandas because people like them. Whoever spends the money on keeping pandas around has already considered this, and he thinks it's worth it.

Many other things, such as music and balloons could be considered a waste of resources if people didn't like them.",91,"The WWF wants to promote biodiversity in a variety of things other than Pandas.

"I believe that Congress should have only one chamber, rather than two, one with proportional representation (the House of Representatives), and one with fixed representation (the Senate). The process by which a bill goes through Congress seems to me to be unnecessarily complicated by having two chambers, and I believe the legislative process would run more smoothly with only one.

As it stands, bills have to start in one chamber, then go to the other, then fly back and forth between them as many changes are made, sometimes only to be changed back, and multiple votes have to be taken when one would suffice. It gets particularly slow and unproductive when the chambers are controlled by opposite parties. I can't think of anything two chambers can do that one can't do better. Changes to bills can be good, but that can happen internally, it doesn't need to be external. There is no need to have different committees in different chambers, one set of committees in one chamber would suffice. One chamber suffices for floor debate, and, most importantly, one chamber is all that is needed to pass legislation and to represent the people. An extra chamber is nothing more than an extra complication, that slows the process but adds nothing to it to improve the quality of legislation, and just leads to more political theatre and less productivity. Obviously, such things will exist regardless, but the existence of two chambers exacerbates the problem.

I just don't see any real advantage to this mess. Even the people who created this system didn't really desire two chambers, it was merely an acceptable sacrifice to reach a compromise between people desiring proportional and fixed representation. I think people would be able to understand the legislative process a lot better if it was clearer, and the process would overall just be more efficient with no loss in the quality of legislation.

Note: I intentionally did not discuss which form of representation I would prefer, proportional, fixed, mixed, or other. I do have a preference, but I consider that a separate issue from the number of chambers.

EDIT: I have been convinced that under our current system, this would not be feasible. However, I think that if elections were publicly funded, or some other means of comprehensive campaign finance reform, and gerrymandering were similarly eliminated, that it would then be beneficial to have a unicameral legislature, with the same proportional system as the House of Representatives. This would allow the voters to have the power they should have anyway that would be sufficient to help keep the system under control.

"To me, this is the exact same issue, just a different year. In 1967, the US passed a law which made it legal for two people of different races to marry; and just recently, in the year 2015, the US made it legal for two people of the same sex to marry. 

Some of the arguments i have seen in opposition of gay marriage are:

* ""homosexuality is a sin""

* ""not natural""

* ""erodes the sanctity of marriage""

* ""slippery slope leading to marriage of _____""

* ""not healthy for children""

* ""goes against God""

These all seem to be the same arguments that were presented in the 1950's and 1960's when people were fighting for marriage equality between the races. So why haven't people learned anything about equality over the last 60 years?


edit #1: The best argument iv seen thus far was by /u/moonflower when they said 

&gt;""Racial difference is not the same as sex difference, even if some of the the arguments against them sound similar.""

This isnt an end all statement; but a great point. What is the difference?

College tuition, as in, 18 years from now.

I know this excludes about 95% of the population, and I know everyone wants to make copies of themselves, but it seems very irresponsible.  

The two trends are that seem to be increasing relentlously are college tuition costs and percentage of people attending college, I blame the system for this, not the individuals, as the U.S. moves further away from manufacturing, the need for college educating people in our work force increases, there are less and less jobs available that *don't* require college.  

It seems downright irresponsible to bring someone into a world that expects them to go to college and be $500,000 (or whatever it will be in 18 years) in debt.

You should work hard just like your parents did to pay for their educations and everything they have. Don't be lazy, don't expect hand outs, they don't come to you in the real life. If you want something, work for. Hustle, do what ever it takes to pay the bills. If your not willing to do that, you can't blame anyone but yourself.",r1,0.7,0.5,0.8,0.6,0.5,0.0,0.8,0.2,0.7,0.0,0.3,0.7,0.5,0.3,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.5,0.6,0.0,r1,,
"Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. Given that killing animals for food is not generally immoral^1 ,  there is not such a great difference between the experience of a baby cow and an adult cow that one will experience death any differently than the other; neither is the life of a cow so rich and fulfilling^2 that it's immoral to deprive a baby cow of it before it dies.

Therefore, I should not feel any worse eating veal than I do eating a hamburger.

^1 If you disagree with this, that's a different argument entirely; I'm glad to hear your opinion on the matter, but you won't change my view unless your argument assumes this point.

^2 Just the opposite, presently; the lives of cows are full of pain and discomfort, because our (American) food-raising process is horrifying. I *do* think that this is unethical, just based on the principle that pain is a bad thing, but it's not a massive priority for me because I think the amount of human suffering is significantly greater at this time than the amount of animal suffering (due to the greater capacity of a human to experience suffering). Again, this isn't the topic of my CMV, but if you want to give your opinion on the matter I'd be glad to hear it.

I'll take on your argument here though. I've been meaning to look into this more in depth anyway.

So I disagree with you that (1) does not matter. The only way for me to say that it is worse to kill a baby cow than an adult cow is to say that there are degrees of badness in killing animals, and that requires me to be able to say that it can be bad to kill an animal, otherwise I could only say that it is not bad to kill animals, and there could be no degree of immorality in that scenario. And I think you must admit that there are degrees of such, as my neighbor's pet dog is clearly much happier than a calf in a veal crate, and you have said that happiness and suffering does matter in animals. The question is then, does the calf suffer more than your average beef cow?

Now while I think you under-estimate the cow's ability to feel pain, I don't think I need to press this point so much as the difference between a veal calf's reality and a standard beef cow's. Beef cows do spend time outside. Here's an [EPA article](http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/ag101/beefphases.html) on the subject. However, the outside they spend time in often does not have grass, and is only a feedlot. During winter they can be confined inside, and also confined a few months before slaughter to help fatten them up. They are most often dehorned as well, without anesthetic. However, veal calves not only experience all this, (94% of dairy calves are dehorned, while about 17% of those calves are given anesthetic. [Page 109](http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/dairy/downloads/dairy07/Dairy07_ir_CalfHealth.pdf). There's no debate that dehorning causes pain.) but must do so *while being starved and confined in a crate for the entirety of their life.* So I think we can say that veal calves suffer at least twice as much as your average beef cow.

Duration of suffering matters too though. So how long is that miserable calf's existence? The MSPCA says veal calves suffer [for about 18 weeks](http://www.mspca.org/programs/animal-protection-legislation/animal-welfare/farm-animal-welfare/factory-farming/cows/veal-calves-on-a-factory-farm.html), or 4.5 months before slaughter, and since the age of veal calves is such a contentious issue, pretty much all sources have the same number. I couldn't find any official data on beef cows, (or steers), but scouring around forums gives me about 18 months for commercially raised, non-grass fed beef. ([1](http://www.homesteadingtoday.com/livestock-forums/cattle/235359-age-slaughter-steer.html),[2](http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/beef-farming/page-7),[3](http://www.grass-fed-solutions.com/feeding-cattle.html)).

So the numbers add up quite nicely, 18/4.5 = 4, meaning steers suffer for 4 times as long as veal calves before slaughter. So the suffering of 1 veal calf is 1 unit, and a steer is 4 units. However, (and there is official USDA data on this, thank god), we get about [880 lbs](http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/BD7FAEF0-CFC8-3E27-A0EB-67C04E8FB488) of edible meat per beef cow, and only about [175 lbs](http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/4D51FF2B-04BC-3312-8D46-ED424F7C2D01) per veal calf. 880/175 = ~5, meaning per lb of meat you eat, you cause a 5x longer duration of suffering for veal calves. do the math and we have 5 units of suffering per lb of veal eaten, and 4 units per lb of beef. This is purely on a basis of duration, not intensity, of suffering... even though as I've argued above, we have good reason to believe that veal calves suffer more. So you would have to actually argue not only that veal calves don't suffer more, but that they actually *suffer less*, in order to justify the view that eating veal is no worse than eating beef.

On top of that, every purchase of veal covers a negative expense of the dairy industry. If we stopped paying for veal, not only would the dairy industry lose its profits, but it would actually suffer, as it would still be producing calves, simply not selling them. Whereas if we were to stop buying burgers, the beef industry would stop raising cattle, and would lose profits, but not actually go into debt.

And finally, there's a great practical reason to consider veal worse than beef, once again, *even if the suffering is the same.* Imagine I give you the opportunity to live in two societies. One in which it is considered just as bad to kill an adult as it is a baby, and one in which it is considered worse to kill a baby than an adult. I think it's clear that a society that considers cruelty to adults not as bad as cruelty to children would be a better society, for indirect reasons such as the need to protect children more, and the moral innocence of children, and by saying that there's nothing worse in killing a baby for food than there is in killing an adult, you're supporting a worse society, however rational your view may seem at surface.

All things considered, I think there's very good reason to find killing baby cows for food more immoral than killing adult cows, even though both are clearly immoral.","Since the lives of cattle are unpleasant, on the surface it seems that slaughtering them at an earlier age would minimize suffering and would therefore be less immoral.

The reality of veal however, is that it is essentially a by-product of the dairy industry.  To keep cows lactating they must constantly be producing calves.  Excess male calves are often used for veal rather than raised as steers, or (very rarely) breeding bulls simply because it takes less time and space away from their more profitable mothers.  A dairy cow generally lives about 5 years until it's milk production wanes, while steers raised for meat are only forced to live 18 months or so, and obviously veal calves get to die very quickly.

So while killing baby cows may alleviate more suffering than killing adult cows for food, in practice it is inextricably linked to keeping adult cows alive for food, causing them to suffer far more than they would had they been raised for meat rather than milk.  Add to the fact that many of these calves wouldn't have to be born or suffer at all if not for their essential role in keeping dairy cows lactating.",95,"I actually had this [exact debate yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/39khuv/my_least_favorite_thing_about_australia_is_their/cs4srum) over on /r/vegan, I'm curious if you were motivated by that to post this?

"People talk about 'natural' or 'God-given rights', but all rights can be taken from you. If rights like ""free speech"" or ""free association"" are 'inalienable', 'natural', or 'God-given', how come so many people don't have them. ""Rights"" are created by the state, on their terms.

I hear alot of people claiming ""The right to free speech"", or ""The right to the pursuit of happiness"". Looking at the world in these terms is false, misleading and detrimental to society. No rights are absolute- the world would be screwed if they were. Laws about inciting violence, truth in advertising, libel, slander, pornography, threats, extortion, racial vilification, sexual harassment, tax fraud and many, many more, all limit free speech, but are vital for society. 
Can I ""pursue happiness"" by running over the elderly in my F150, or selling crack to toddlers? But I got the ""right""!! right? All 'rights' have limits. Looking at things purely in terms of ""rights""
creates a selfish, narcissistic, entitled, unreasonable mindset.

Rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin, but there's no ""Bill of Responsibilities"". Talking about 'Rights' like this
makes people think they can do what they want, coz ""I got Rights!!"". 

Rights are a myth, and we need a better model for thinking about personal freedom.
_____
","Former civics teacher here. Regarding your statement that 

&gt; Rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin, but there's no ""Bill of Responsibilities""

and the implication that we need to refer more to responsibilities of citizenship, I agree 100%. There is a sense of entitlement among American citizens today; I can't say if it's existed in other epochs, but it does seem to have a deleterious effect on our political discourse, and on civil society more generally.

That said, the notion that

&gt; Rights are a myth

and

&gt; 'Rights' are not a real thing. They exist only as much as the state allows

is a dangerous one. The notion of limited government, i.e. a government created of, by, and for the people, which can only create new laws within the framework of a constitution, exists to protect citizens from the excesses of unchecked government power. The companion notion of natural rights is necessary for the conception of limited government. If, as you claim, rights come *from the government*, what stops government from switching things up and determining that, for example, we don't have a right to due process? (Some would argue that this is already happening, but I'll get to that in a moment.) That we don't have a right to the proceeds of our labor? What if the President decided that he needed a new palace, that term limits--hell, even those pesky elections--aren't really necessary, and so he upped the tax rate to near 100% and declared himself emperor? Historically, all a ruler needs is the support of the elites and the military to make that happen. A generally-accepted belief in limited government and natural rights doesn't inherently prevent these abuses, but it's a very good first step. (It's especially a good step because the members of the military, who generally aren't the elites, will have been conditioned to believe in limited government just as they have been conditioned to follow strict lines of authority, so they're less likely to quietly sign on to a power grab by a rogue President.)

As to your point below that 

&gt; 'rights' aren't about compromise; they're about entitlement

this is patently false. Rights will necessarily conflict. There are very few moral systems that argue that there are not overlaps in rights, where priority must be given to some over others. (Modern American libertarians would make the argument that the Non-Aggression Principle is a single rule to determine all disputes, but this is problematic in its own right; for example, it allows for the extreme interpretation that my current self cannot 'enslave' my future self by signing contracts, making the entire institution of binding agreements null and void. I think that any moral system with this level of ""clarity"" necessarily tends toward allowing absurdity like this, if not actively encouraging it.) This is the reason we require a (preferably impartial) judiciary: to determine the precedence and priority of various rights. For example, in the most famous example, my 1st Amendment right to yell ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater has been deemed, rightfully, to be trumped by society's collective right not to have its citizens deliberately cause physical harm to others. (You could very easily frame that collective right as my responsibility not to cause physical harm to others, and I would agree with it.)

But wait, you say, that's **government** determining rights! You're [I am] wrong! Rights *do* come from government!

Well, not quite. As a civil society, we need some arbiter that we can all appeal to when our rights come into conflict. Since government has existed seemingly since time immemorial, we have attempted to harness its power to that end. And that's all government is, a way of aggregating power. We like to think that it represents and protects all of us, but government is very easily captured by people who have disproportionate power or wealth to begin with, making it a dangerous tool. Yes, we need government (or some other collectively agreeable arbiter) to decide questions of *whose rights or responsibilities win out in a conflict*, but that doesn't mean the rights in question came from government in the first place. Just because a corrupt government chooses not to protect a set of rights, or actively chooses to violate them (as many police forces seem to be ignoring our 4th Amendment rights, especially in seeking out citizens with drugs), **does not** mean that we didn't have that right to begin with. It is a precondition for challenging the government to the extent necessary to restore the rights. If, as you say, rights *come from government*, then we should ignore public outrage about the TSA, about the War on Drugs, about Ferguson and Baltimore and the myriad places where cops kill people of color, because those are all instances of government agents acting against private citizens. And if those agents, acting according to the rules of their agencies (which can't be doubted, since officers in these situations are extremely rarely prosecuted or punished), have denied citizens their rights, including their right to life, then that right must not have existed in the first place, right?","I'm not here to completely change your mind. On the responsibilities note:

My understanding of rights-based political philosophy is that rights are the bare minimum of what peoples generally agree on as the bare minimum of requirements for people to be able to pursue something like freedom or a good life. Rights aren't enabling you to do anything - they are restricting the government from interfering in your life. (The most cited example of this misunderstanding in the US is people who say ridiculous things and then cite the first amendment of the US constitution- the first amendment limits government censorship - not fellow citizens.)

The responsibilities bit is not brought up because (1) it is presupposed that most people won't step-up and (2) taking responsibility in open society has its own rewards. So on the first note, guess what there were drunks/deadbeats/dropouts in every day and age - and so you know that some people aren't even capable of a full public life (ie voting, volunteering, getting involved in the community, stepping up at work, etc, etc). Also, to be fair, a lot political philosophy was only about property-owning men - their very lives were based on their supremacy over everyone else. So for instance, you couldn't argue that non-property owning men and women would have public responsibilities because it would undermine the mental model of inferior women and non-property owners.

Point two, where responsibility is its own reward:
The other aspect of it is that it was assumed that if you became part of public society you got to do all these other fun things: dances, you could network for your job or future wife, meet interesting people, potentially take political office, siphon public funds etc etc.

The rights model is based on a morally-normative model and is therefore problematic. But this was known quite a long time ago: even Spinoza's (mid-1600's) political philosophy, more or less, replaces rights with abilities and interest.

But all philosophy aside- what is of dire interest to me is why Americans seem to be (1) uninterested in history and or (2) unwilling to hold our government to the basic principles of both our constitution and our founding.

It's very interesting to me that people rationalize government misdeeds and overreaches - or make ironic jokes about them. (""I'm sure I'm on a list somewhere."") Or they may simply shrug and say: ""They are only catching the bad guys."" As if that isn't how every horrifying misdeed starts or somehow makes it better that they lied to American congress.

Although the underlying mechanics of statistics are undoubtedly mathematical, increasingly it is becoming recognized as a discipline in its own right, with its own methodology and best practices distinct from those of pure mathematics, and the structure of high school should reflect this divergence.  At the high school level, the focus of statistics pedagogy should be on core concepts, the appropriate use of technology, and interpretation-- you are teaching a student to turn data into an accurate, precise probablistic statement, and to have an intuitive understanding of the probability concepts underlying the meaning of that statement.  These are important skills, but they aren't really *mathematical* skills in the traditional sense; you are reasoning in a different mode.  


In a well-taught algebra, geometry, or calculus class, by contrast, students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively, learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence, solve non-routine problems, and use mathematics of all types to analyze real-world phenomena.  None of these skills except arguably the last play any role in an elementary statistics curriculum.  


You can argue that a deep facility with ""abstract"" math has little importance in the ""real world,"" but increasingly the 21st century economy *does* reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem-solving, even if you are never directly using specific skills (the classic ""when will I ever need the quadratic formula in real life"" bugbear).  Finally, learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields, which statistics training will not replace.  Thus, BOTH statistics and math, as separate disciplines, should have a role in the high school curriculum.


As a final note, I should mention that I am here presupposing that both statistics and pure math can are taught *well.*  Obviously, a well-taught statistics class is much more useful than a poorly-taught math class, and vice-versa.  I'm well aware that bad mathematics teaching (and bad statistics teaching, for that matter) is rampant in the U.S., so I'd prefer to keep the horror stories along those lines out of this particular discussion and stay focused on the best-case possibilities of both subjects.


**EDIT:** Thank you to those of you who have been willing to engage me on the substantive pedagogical questions.  I have re-thought my initial claim and now concede that there are alternatives to the traditional algebra sequence when it comes to teaching abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills.  I still stand by my argument that statistics fundamentally stands apart from math, and should probably be seen as a separate subject with some connections to math (akin to physics or computer science) rather than as an optional class within the math department.  But there are alternatives to the algebra-geometry-trig-calculus sequence that might better reinforce the connections between statistics and math while still accomplishing all the important educational goals.


**To those of you more interested in debating the logistical nuts and bolts (concerns about burdensome mandates on schools, etc.):** thank you also for your participation in the conversation.  Some have made arguments that all state mandates on school curriculum are unnecessarily burdensome or will cost too much; I believe this premise has empirically denied, so these arguments are not convincing to me.  Others have made the point that, in the event that states are unwilling to add new credit hours to their diploma requirements, we risk adding statistics at the expense of electives or core courses.  This is a more compelling argument, but ultimately a risk I am willing to take, since I believe that in most if not all states there is room in the existing credit structure to responsibly add statistics in place of at least one course.  As a separate issue, I think increasing credit hour minimums and extended school days are serious proposals that should be given consideration as possibilities, though it is not my intent to make a full argument in favor of them here.  Unless you have something substantially different to offer than the above two arguments, I doubt I will be convinced by further discussion along these lines.


Thank you again to all who responded.

I think [what I said then](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3eqdj5/cmv_a_statistics_course_should_be_required_as/cthkp5o) applies here: if we have to chose, discrete math is more valuable than statistics.

This is mostly going to be an argument that discrete math should replace something in the calculus-track curriculum. However, many introductory discrete math courses spend a fair amount of time covering statistics, and I think that's very valuable for many of the same reasons you've covered. I think that discrete math courses typically paint a very coherent story up to statistics -- much more so than jumping straight into statistics. You talk about deductive reasoning, set theory, combinatorics, and probability before getting to statistics. I think learning and understanding all of those things helps frame statistics in a more intuitive way. For example, Bayes' Theorem (which is, in my experience, a topic in most introductory statistics courses) is much better understood with a firm understanding of deductive reasoning, set theory, and probability.

You say this about calculus-track curricula: 

&gt; In a well-taught algebra, geometry, or calculus class, by contrast, students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively, learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence, solve non-routine problems, and use mathematics of all types to analyze real-world phenomena.

I fervently agree that learning to reason deductively is important. Wouldn't you say that a better way to learn deductive reasoning is to teach it directly? 

&gt; You can argue that a deep facility with ""abstract"" math has little importance in the ""real world,"" but increasingly the 21st century economy does reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem-solving, even if you are never directly using specific skills (the classic ""when will I ever need the quadratic formula in real life"" bugbear). Finally, learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields, which statistics training will not replace. Thus, BOTH statistics and math, as separate disciplines, should have a role in the high school curriculum.

Again -- totally agree abstract reasoning is important. I just don't think calculus or algebra are the best topics to teach this skill to the average student. Too often they devolve into rote application of formula or theorems that have no meaning to the student. Teaching deductive reasoning directly generally doesn't suffer from this problem, because the theorems that do exist are incredibly intuitive.

In closing, I'd propose that a better change to high school math curriculum would be:

1. For the general population, teach discrete math instead of (pre-)calculus. Topics should include deductive reasoning, set theory, probability, and statistics.
2. For more advanced students, offer followup courses in both statistics and calculus.  (I guess this is probably already the case at most good schools).","I haven't really seen this point brought up here, so I may as well: you seem to be assuming the typical algebra/trig/precalc/calc track is representative of pure math. Many would disagree with that. Calculus and the classes leading up to it are a notoriously horrible representation of pure mathematics and, while I don't really have a great argument against putting statistics into standard high school educations (apart from the lack-of-resources argument others have mentioned), I can at least argue that, whether or not statistics is thrown in, calculus should probably be thrown out.

I'm just going to preemptively say, though - Lockhart did a much better job articulating it than I can in his short paper [A Mathematician's Lament](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf). I don't mean to pass the debating on to someone else, but if you've got time I'd really recommend reading it.

The main point is that calculus and the courses leading up to it are far too rooted in applications - they're treated as though they're going to be useful to students later in life, because in the minds of administrators, that's how putting them in the curriculum is justified. Because of that, teachers and students alike end up perpetuating the myth that math is, at its core, supposed to be useful and applicable. That's entirely the wrong idea, though. There is math that's useful, but applications aren't the reason we practice math, nor the reason we're interested in it. The real value of math is that it's beautiful, interesting, and most of all personally enriching. It helps develop important parts of our minds, from articulating ideas to critical thinking to problem solving. Calculus is the centerpiece of the high school math education not because it's beautiful or enriching but because it's perceived to be useful, and that's harmful to students (who, generally speaking, waste time learning it without ever using it) and to the general population (who, generally speaking, regard math as a tedious object to be wielded only for the purposes of science).

So, if the people creating high school curricula wanted to put in a ""math"" class that's actually useful, statistics would be a much better choice, I'm sure. I believe many more people would find themselves being able to apply it to their daily lives. I would hope the world doesn't forget what math actually is, though, and I would hope that, whether statistics is added or not, calculus is either replaced (by something that's actually done for its own value) or dropped entirely.

"Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on to the next news story and give the subject little other thought.

Just reading about these events does not have this effect and I can forget about the issues relatively quickly.

Secondly I am sure some people cannot visually imagine how horrific these events are.  Being exposed to footage of it will be a shock and a wake up call to how bad life can be for some people.  This in turn will make them more likely to take action.

I will make it plain that I do not think people should be viewing these sorts of videos for entertainment of any kind.

Finally it seems I am not alone, [this article](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/sean-penn-watches-isis-beheading-videos-out-of-moral-obligation-the-problem-is-we-are-not-seeing-enough-of-real-violence-10127603.html) may help you understand my argument better than I can express it.

EDIT:  Some of the responses have made me realise that what I am suggesting would have different effects on different people and as such viewing these videos may not always cause people to act in a positive way as it has with me.

"I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying this was shameful, and embarrassing to the US military, a ridiculous simplification. To be clear, I am no fan of Huckabee, and I have nothing against our military or militaries in general. That said, I think he was dead on.

I think most people who don't accept this do so because they think it's crass, and brutal. Well, yeah, but it's also absolutely true. That's why the military has all those rifles and artillery and tanks and battleships and bombs and chemical weapons and knives and humvees and machine guns: for the killing of people and the breaking of things. Sure, not every member of the military's job is to be a killer, but those people are there to support the killers. The cooks, mechanics, engineers, and secretaries are all there to let everyone else kill people and break things as safely and efficiently as possible.

Again, I have absolutely no problem with this from a moral perspective. I am certainly not condemning anybody, just stating facts. Most people I've seen disagree with Huckabee are just dancing around this. ""Soldiers exist to protect the United States and her interests!"" Sure, using violence or the threat of violence. ""The army doesn't just kill people, they developed the Internet!"" Yeah, as a weapon to coordinate their violence in the most efficient way possible. The internet we have now is just an unintended side effect.

The US military is in a bit of a unique position, since they haven't had a lot of opportunities to do their job recently. Our military is so badass, there are not a lot of people with enough courage or stupidity to take us on. Thus, a lot of time is spent running practice drills and handing out food to people after earthquakes. That's great, but it's all a displacement activity until they need to do their real job. It's a sideshow, a distraction. The alternative would be these men sitting around, waiting for something to need destroying. We don't keep our military around and spend billions of dollars for disaster relief. We keep them around to kill people and break things. That's their real purpose, simple as that.

"Background: In a nutshell, I had a Christian upbringing. Went through a few years basically as an Atheist until I had an existential crisis and turned to Buddhism.

This is gonna be a tough one as it is a very sweeping statement, so I will do my best to elaborate what I mean.

**Religion**: This has been talked about endlessly, but I feel like many of the issues at least with the Abrahamic religions (the Crusades, terrorism, gay rights, etc.) comes down to a belief in an objective right vs wrong. Even though I've met plenty of Christians who actively question their faith and interpretation of the Bible, the Abrahamic faiths still come down to external rules that are at odds with human nature, particularly sexuality. Just look at how intrusive Sharia Law can be.

**Science**: While my teenage Atheist-leaning side of me would like to think that there is a huge gap between religion and science, science did arise out of Christianity after all, and its dogmatic leanings still show today. [Here's a banned TED talk by Rupert Sheldrake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKHUaNAxsTg) on a so-called ""science delusion"" (a play on the ""God Delusion""). While I do not agree with him entirely, I think he poses a very important point. The materialist worldview it has come to is very limiting compared to the original intent of the scientific method.

My view is that while we can be taught, it is up to us to learn through our own experiences and choose whether or not to accept the said teachings, as opposed to blind faith. However, I feel this is a dangerous view to have as it is not only is a rebellious one, but also heavily degrades my respect for the Abrahamic religions and a good chunk of the scientific community. I'd really like to see the other side of this.

&gt; My view is that while we can be taught, it is up to us to learn through our own experiences and choose whether or not to accept the said teachings, as opposed to blind faith

This is, in essence, the difference between science and religion.

Theories and laws in science are based on reproducible experiments - this means that anyone with the right equipment should be able to reach the same results as anyone else when doing the experiment. This, in itself, makes science un-dogmatic (is that even a word?).  
Naturally, not everyone can complete the experiments themselves, so we trust that an experiment is good if a number of independent scientists reproduce it - this is known as peer reviewing. This introduces a *bit* of what you're talking about, as we have to trust a ""higher authority"" (in this case a number of scientists) that what they're saying is true. However, this is a trade off that is impossible to solve, and as such must be accepted for all knowledge.

However, what I think you're talking about is how this knowledge is spread to the general public. In ""popular science"" shows, you'll often find that new hypothesis' or theories are presented as truths - which is wrong. These are not truths, and within the scientific community they are not considered as such. In fact, truth as an absolute does not exist as a scientific term. In other words, science is not dogmatic. However, some media can present it in a dogmatic way.","Ooh I love discussing this! It saddens me that science and religion are seen as opposite ends of a spectrum. As you said, science by and large arose from religious people.


Addressing the topic, both scientists and theists are often dogmatic. Where you are wrong is the part where you said science itself and religion itself is dogmatic. The true nature of both are not dogmatic. I am using only Christianity as religion in this argument because that is what I am most familiar with and I'm sure you can find a religion that is dogmatic but Christianity I have found to also be most reasonable. 


The Bible says that ""faith is the evidence of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."" This is basically the definition of science though the word faith isn't used ever in scientific circles because over the years, the definition of faith has become ""belief without evidence"" (dogmatic) as opposed to the biblical definition above, which is clearly not dogmatic, it requires evidence and reason. Paul in fact once said ""we are not mad, but merely speak the words of truth and reason."" 


I'd also like to point out that having an absolute standard is not necessarily dogmatic. Saying ""This is the absolute standard, follow it because fuck you."" is certainly dogmatic. However, it is not dogmatic to say: ""This absolute standard that I am about to give you is directly from the mouth of God who created you and who created morality itself. I will now show you proof that I am from God because *insert evidence*. To show the power of God I will now perform a miracle in front of all of you so you can tell others and document it painstakingly throughout the years. Now that you believe me, I will now lay down the standard and explain why this makes sense. This is obviously the best option but it is up to you to make the right choice, I won't make you."" The Bible says and does basically this. 


Whether you believe the evidence in the Bible or evidence for God in general is irrelevant to this conversation. If in your opinion the evidence does not hold up, ok that's fine. But don't say that it is dogmatic because it isn't, it presented evidence and a choice. 


Now, science should do the same thing. Gather the evidence, make a hypothesis, gather even more evidence, make it a theory, have hundreds of to people besides you gather a crap ton of overwhelming evidence that points to one conclusion and then MAYBE make it a scientific law. And after that, never stop gathering evidence in case you are wrong. 


What happens sometimes is this process is not always followed and things become a theory without enough evidence because of bias or the innate lack of evidence so the option that makes the most sense is upgraded to a theory. What also happens is some individual scientists become very dogmatic and arrogant and treat flimsy hypothesis like indisputable facts and criticize anyone who does not agree. 


Christians can and do do the same thing, as well as setting their own traditions on the same level as the Bible. But does this mean science itself and religion itself are inherently dogmatic. No. No no no. ",100,"(Please note that I am arguing against the view expressed in the title)

"Consent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved that what they're doing, and how they're doing it, is okay with their partner(s). Consent also allows for things that would otherwise be creepy or weird to come into a positive light and expressed in a healthy way. I would consider the act of objectifying to fall under this category. For example, a woman may be creeped out if a dude right in front of her at a party is just staring at her boobs without any concern for her at all. The same act of staring at the boobs is 100% fine if it's with her boyfriend while they're having consensual sexual relations.

If we take this same line of logic of consent that happens with sex and put it with masturbation, that's where I'm going with this. If you're thinking about another person in a sexual manner without them knowing about it, and then acting out that thought process by masturbating, it just seems a bit creepy to me. If I'm not allowed to objectify or do other sexual acts in person without having consent from the other person, I don't see how that wouldn't also translate over to masturbation. It's the same sexual thoughts, feelings, and intentions with the only difference being that the partner is not physically with you. Because they're not there with you, you can't ask for proper consent unless you physically ask them some other time if you can masturbate about them.

This line of thought has logic to it, but it's a conclusion that I don't like to face. This line of thought potentially makes masturbation an awful act if done without consent. It also makes it an act that wouldn't be allowed if no one gave any consent to you. You might be able to say that pornography that was paid for might be consensual masturbation because the model is being paid, and is therefore willing to consent to you masturbating. Even so, this doesn't allow you to explore your sexual desires outside of straight up porn unless someone says it's okay. If you asked me whether I'm for or against masturbation, I would say that I'm very pro-masturbation. The act has health benefits, relieves stress, is pleasurable, and all sorts of other fun goodies. It makes it so I don't want to come to the conclusion that I've come to that it needs strict consent about the person(s) that's involved in one's fantasies.

So please, CMV!

EDIT: After reading over the many replies I've gotten (thank you all) I think my view has already sufficiently changed. Consent with masturbation has more of a tendency to be harmful than helpful and positive. There's a difference between one's thoughts and actions, and masturbation causes no harm if the one being fantasied about isn't informed. There was also the argument that ones thoughts and fantasies should be their own, and no one else's. Control of your own thoughts is a human necessity, and putting a limit on them could be hazardous. As long as I keep a mental image of someone in tact of who they are, and not just seeing them as a sex object, I think it's all fine and dandy.

Thanks guys. I felt like I must've been wrong with my logic somewhere, and you helped point to where. I needed that. :)

"To start, I'm not here to discuss wealth distribution, or income inequality. They are real issues that need to be addressed, and as much as governments like to talk about the middle class, they aren't doing much that actually helps them.

The inflation: Middle class families used to live in 2-4 bedroom 1-2 bath bungalows in the suburbs or small towns. Quite often siblings would share a bedroom, there would be fights over who got to shower first because there was only one shower and a finite amount of hot water. You packed a sandwich for lunch, dad drove the one car the family owned and would own for the next 10 years to work and mom walked or took transit if available. Clothing was handed down to younger siblings or cousins, there was one modestly sized TV in the house, and when families got a computer it was for the entire family to share. Vacations where often to go camping somewhere which would involve tents and no electricity, not 50' trailers with full kitchens, bathrooms and wifi, and if you were to go on a trip to another country or something, it was something the family saved up for and didn't happen every year. If something was broken, you fixed it instead of throwing it out and buying three more. 

While all of that might sound like it came out of Leave it to Beaver or The Brady Bunch, I grew up in the 90's. 

Now, ""middle class"" people are shopping for luxury/designer brand clothing, cars, and other goods. It's practically considered child abuse to suggest that kids share a bedroom or don't have their own computer, tablet, and phone, and there is no way they would wear clothing handed down or two years old. Suburban/small town homes are multi level McMansions with granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances, multiple big screen tvs, and master bathrooms with Jacuzzi tubs and rain showers. The family car is two or three cars, potentially more if there kids old enough to drive at home, and instead of the kids going for a weekend at grandma's while the parents drive three hours away for a vacation where they stay in a motel and go out for a nice dinner, the whole family flies to an all inclusive resort in another country. 

Yes, many of those things are cheaper than they once were, but many of them would have been considered luxuries or unattainable a generation ago and that would have been perfectly acceptable. Instead we lament the decline of the ""middle class"" while we continue to inflate what a middle class lifestyle is supposed to look like. 

**tl;dr the ""middle class"" is shrinking because what used to be defined as middle class would currently be considered below it, and what is currently ""middle"" class would have been upper-middle to ""rich"" in the past. Instead of lamenting the decline of the middle class we should reevaluate how we define it. CMV**

"I have recently been told that my pro-life position is ""forcing my ideas on others"".  I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary.  This "" forcing ideals on others"" is an argument I hear often and I just want to understand it better. I believe that a fetus is a human being. I confess, that is my view, not everyone's view. I believe an abortion is the murder of that child. This is still my view. Not everyone's. United States law entitles all humans to life. Passing legislation opposing abortion is simply following that idea in my way. I am not forcing anyone to agree with me. I am simply making sure the law is followed as I read it.

It's 1870 and there is a white who believes that black people are subhuman (not so uncommon at the time). If I say no they are not subhuman. They are human beings and I will prosecute you if you kill them am I "" forcing my ideals on them"" or am I simply protecting what I believe to be human life.

"Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said:

What happens after the honeymoon period when one person still desires sex, but their partner has lost interest (commonly referred to as a [dead bedroom](http://reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms))?

I think it's still the duty of the disinterested party to at least minimally fulfill the sexual needs of their partner, if sustaining the relationship is a priority. In bullet form, here's why:

* Each partner in the relationship is the others' only source of intimacy and sex (assuming a monogamous relationship), therefore if one partner withholds sex, the physical needs of the other is not being met. What is ultimately a chore or an inconvenience for one partner is a physiological necessity for the other.

* Compromise is fundamentally part of every aspect of a relationship, and sex is no different. I'm conflicted in my thinking on this point: No one should be made to have sex if they don't want to. However, both my SO and I do things for each other that we don't necessarily want to do because it's better for the relationship, or it makes the other happy. I don't believe sex and intimacy should be treated differently- it's reasonable to have expectations of sex as a requirement of the relationship.

Thoughts?","First off great job on this CMV it's not often I see people this committed to meaningful debate, especially on this subreddit it seems.

I do believe you are wrong though if you're trying to say that your partner should feel responsible for satisfying your sexual needs. I would agree however that you share a responsibility with your partner to work out your problems in a way that you can both be happy with.

Specifically I would suggest jerking off or agreeing to have sex with other people. If the institutions you follow prevent you from having a satisfying relationship or you are unable to come to a compromise with your spouse then you might reconsider the institution or the spouse. ","You make some really good points, OP. One thing to consider is that sex is not a physiological need, people go without it all the time. The benefits of orgasm can be achieved through masturbation, and the benefits of intimacy can be achieved through cuddling and other intimacy beside sex. If the partner also objects to cuddling and so on, then the high libido person can get this from people outside the relationship, just as a single person would.

"*[This article](https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/12/health-risk-having-gun-home) does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/defensive-gun-ownership-gary-kleck-response-115082.html#.Vdm1n_lVhBc) that lays out some criticisms of the first article's source study, along with a rebuttal from another journalist who's written on the topic.*

I believe that:

1. You, or someone in your family, are more likely to be killed by your gun either purposefully or accidentally than you are to use the gun against an attacker successfully in self-defense.

2. Therefore, if your goal is to make yourself and/or your family safer, then choosing to keep a gun in your home explicitly for that purpose is an irrational decision.


I do believe there is one exception to this. If you have a particular reason or belief that you are likely to be attacked, then, since the odds of being attacked have increased dramatically, then it may be rational to have a gun in the house for self-defense. For example, if you have a stalker. If you have received threats on your life. If you have any reasonable belief that someone will try to harm you specifically. If government or police forces have broken down. Basically, if the odds change so that for you the risk of you or your family being attacked is greater than the risk of having a gun in the house, then it would be rational to have a gun.

But we do know, statistically, on average, that is not the case. So for the average person, the risks are such that the rational decision for maximizing safety is to not keep a gun.

I further believe that if you get other uses out of the gun other than just self-defense, then the other added benefits of having a gun would make it rational to keep one in the house. For example, if somebody was a hunter and or target shooter and they get a lot of joy out of their hobby, that could be worth the risk of gun ownership. Or even if someone cited tradition, or the need of an armed populace as a check on the government, that too could be a perceived benefit to them that makes the safety risk worthwhile. I'm strictly speaking about what's the best decision for maximizing personal and family safety.

Change my view by showing me that the risk of harm to you or your family is lower by having a fire arm in the house.

Ok, I am not advocating for everyone to go pull Lewinskies or anything, but what I'm saying is that they shouldn't be impeached or forced to resign, or face criticism on their ability to lead or shape policy. If they are a good policy maker fine. If they are making the world a better place and fighting for things that other politicians are afraid to then fine. As long as they don't be hypocrites on their policies, so what. Really the Clinton and Lewinsky scandal should have been handled between Bill and his wife, not the media and Congress. A city councilman just stepped down in my city for sexting someone 14 years his junior, however she was 34 and he's 48 neither one married, he's divorced a few years ago... how the hell does that call for a career to be ended? And now the speaker of the Missouri house of reps just resigned because he was sexting the capitol intern. If it was abuse or assault then ok, investigate, charge and punish them appropriately, but if its a matter of consensual legal sexual exchange, who are we to tell them no? I really wanna know why we shame politicians and ruin their careers because of things like sexting?

"We've all heard the saying that a Jack of All Trades is a Master of None.  I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you are good at many things you will never be a ""master"" at some skill or aspect of your life.  

What I am willing to argue is that benefits of being a Jack of All Trades far outweighs the benefits of being a master of one or few ""trades"".

For starters, the possibility of finding the thing that truly makes you happy and satisfied in life is lessened quite significantly if your endeavors are honed into a certain subject at an early age.  The amount of time you spend on a certain skill, hobby, or whatever it may be is inversely related on the amount of time you spend on other aspects of your life.  It is my opinion that when you decide on your calling and devote yourself almost entirely to it, you miss out on other precious and interesting opportunities that your life could include otherwise.  

There is no doubt in my mind that abundant success in life is generated by the willingness to make a sacrifices for the thing that you believe that you want the most.  It is up to the individual to decide what matters to them the most.  Personally though, I think this is such a misguided approach to life that often leaves people feeling unfulfilled when they approach an advanced age.  Is ""success"" in life really that valuable to humans that they are willing to give up so much of their time to a specific task?  The need to be recognized and respected as a master of a particular aspect of life is a major driving factor of the sacrifices people make.   

A Jack of All Trades in my opinion does not mean you have to be great or even good at the things that you try once, or even do on a regular basis.  For sanity's sake though, let's just say a Jack of All Trades is ""good"" at many things and a Master is ""great"" at one thing.  When you set your focus on being great at one aspect of your life, there is the potential to backseat so many other important things in your life.  I think, perhaps, this is best explained with an example.  I have a co-worker who is one of the most vocally well-versed, decorated, and revered employees at the company at which I am employed.  I am still quite young, and I just graduated college and he is one of my mentors.  Working with him has really shown me what true mastery looks like.  However, he spends at least 60+ hours a week at work for no real reason other than the fact that he is potentially obsessed with his work.  At his age, I know for a fact he would rather be spending time with his grand kids; he doesn't view time the same way most others do, and as a result ends up leaving the office at 7 o'clock every night.   

I try not to work overtime unless we are really running behind on a project, because while I love my job, I don't feel the need to devote myself fully to the task.  As a result, I am able to focus on so much else and I am not constantly thinking about one specific thing.  The ability to detach myself from my career after I leave the office (or job site) really seems to subconsciously effect the rest of my day.  I feel more energized when I workout and I don't mind studying other things or brushing up on languages other than English.  I also get the opportunity to socialize more with friends when I leave work on time.  Having weekends off means I have the potential to do whatever I want and I can pick up new hobbies along the way.  So in short I am sacrificing the potential to be great at one thing for the potential to be good (or maybe even just experience) many other things.  

Please don't relegate this to being a work-a-holic and not being a work-a-holic.  This was purely a life example that directly relates to the topic at hand.

I am sure it is possible to be a Master of one or more things and still be good at a lot of other things, but my main point is that a Jack of All Trades is a much more interesting and fulfilling approach to life than dedication to a singular practice.

&gt;I will change your view with a single diagram.
It will demonstrate that in order to become a master of one, a person must first become a Jack of all.

So again, to become a master of a single trade, one must first become a jack of all. Or one cannot understand his or her own trade out of context. This is why we start our educations in kindergarten and not in graduate studies. A wide, solid, strong and synthetic knowledge base is an absolute a priori necessity.

&gt;I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning  

Here is an excerpt from a [textbook on neuro-biology explaining the modern scientific understanding of sex, gender, and gender identity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10943/):  

&gt;&gt;Gender refers more broadly to an individual's subjective perception of their sex and their sexual orientation, and is therefore harder to define than genotypic or phenotypic sex. Generally speaking, gender identity entails self-appraisal according to the traits most often associated with one sex or the other (called gender traits), and these can be influenced to some degree by cultural norms. Sexual orientation also entails self-appraisal in the context of culture. For purposes of understanding the neurobiology of sex, it is helpful to think of genotypic sex as largely immutable, phenotypic sex as modifiable (by developmental processes, hormone treatment, and/or surgery), and gender as a more complex construct that is determined culturally as well as biologically.

[Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.  

&gt;&gt;This is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.

The linked comment addresses everything you've asked. You can also go to /r/asktransgender to talk to actual trans people.

&gt;I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning  

Here is an excerpt from a [textbook on neuro-biology explaining the modern scientific understanding of sex, gender, and gender identity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10943/):  

&gt;&gt;Gender refers more broadly to an individual's subjective perception of their sex and their sexual orientation, and is therefore harder to define than genotypic or phenotypic sex. Generally speaking, gender identity entails self-appraisal according to the traits most often associated with one sex or the other (called gender traits), and these can be influenced to some degree by cultural norms. Sexual orientation also entails self-appraisal in the context of culture. For purposes of understanding the neurobiology of sex, it is helpful to think of genotypic sex as largely immutable, phenotypic sex as modifiable (by developmental processes, hormone treatment, and/or surgery), and gender as a more complex construct that is determined culturally as well as biologically.

&gt;We, as a society, have decided that these are sick individuals who need medical and psychiatric attention. Certainly, an individual with alien hand syndrome could have a procedure to remove their hand in a safe and controlled environment and continue living a suitable life. We don't allow that, though. How is having gender identity issues different from afflictions I have described above?  

[Gender dysphoria is already classified as a mental illness under the DSM V.](http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf) 

&gt;Also, why are these individuals allowed to make unnecessary changes to their body when we don't provide the same liberties to others?  

Because it works. [Here is a comment with multiple citations](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2o02ul/cmv_i_think_transgenderism_is_a_mental_health/cmih4oh) that show current medical understanding of trans issues and the treatment options, especially showing how transition is effective. It also addresses your ""alien hand syndrome"" comment and why treating that isn't comparable to transgenderism.  

I'm reproducing the relevant parts below:  

&gt;&gt;Two, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them.

"Hey,

So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about.... this just doesn't make any sense to me. 

It seems to me that if we could view all orbiting matter on a single plane the size of even the earth's crust it would be very clear that space debris is not an immediate issue. The amount of debris relative to the size of the area is not that much... not even taking into account that it isn't happening on a plane but in 3-D space.

Why is this wrong with this? I guess this doesn't take into account gravity (the gravitational pull of a satellite may be substantial at orbit - making collision highly likely). Or perhaps the scale of damage even a bolt could have.. but these to me seem so remote....

Over the next, 20 years we will launch a lot more satellites - but only/maybe then they may become an issue - but at the present time it's like talking about not getting in your car because you are worried about drunk drivers - it may be acceptable but it is not rational

"There's been so much uproar over Sweden and the Netherlands and other countries that have been dealing with immigration issues. I would like to move to another country in the future so I understand wanting to move to a country in Europe, although I am not seeking asylum from a war torn homeland. At any rate, these countries have a history of an ethnic population and when one thinks of Sweden, there's a certain image just as when one thinks of what and who constitutes any specific country. I would hate to have Sweden be overrun by rampant immigration from any country (my problem is not with the Muslim population specifically/Middle eastern immigration but the idea of rampant immigration in general) just as I would hate for any other country, let's say Bangladesh, to be overrun with let's say, British immigration.

"I have come to this conclusion for several reasons.
*The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience alone it is the country most likely to use them again.

*The main positive effect of atomic weapons, that gets brought up a lot , is mutually assured destruction. The USA dropped 2 atomic bombs, not as retribution to an atomic attack. It demonstrated a lower bar for considering using them.

*The USA regularly starts new wars. It's certainly the nation among the big superpowers that is most likely to initiate a new war and, in the case of Irak, can not even explain why they went to war in the first place.

"I'm a lifelong veggie, and I've been vegan for a while in the past although I'm not anymore.

I don't believe you can make a rock solid case for being veggie, unless you refer to climate change, and once you look at that I think the case for being vegan is unanswerable, I still have regrets that I'm not vegan, although not major ones, as otherwise I'd not eat pizza quite so much.

That said I do think there is also an ethical argument against harming animals who can feel pain and have a capacity to suffer. I certainly think this is the case with most medium to large size mammals like cats, dogs, pigs, chickens, dolphins and whatnot. For that reason I wouldn't eat those animals even if it was sustainable to do so, unless I was sure they had been reared and killed humanely.

When it comes to animals who are clearly less conscious I don't feel the same way. I don't have any qualms about swatting flies, and I also recognise the need for pest control. I wouldn't have any problem with lethal rat traps being used in a restaurant (although obviously that should go hand in hand with taking measures to discourage them being in the kitchen in the first place like not leaving food out overnight).

I don't know if fish can experience pain or not. I don't know if they can suffer like other higher mammals can. 

As I don't know for sure, I'm reluctant to join in with the fishing that'll take place when we go and stay with my partners family at a cottage near a river which allows for excellent fishing. 

I quite like the idea of fly fishing, I feels it's pretty sustainable (I might be wrong), and also that fish probably don't have the mental capacity to suffer (I might be wrong again). I'd rather avoid doing something I'll learn that I shouldn't have done in 20 years though than take the risk.

Most importantly, it looks like they lack the brain capacity to actually feel pain (which is a psychological thing, not a physiological one).

Also, not your main point, but if you care about animals dying/suffering, [being a vegetarian might be worse than being an omnivore.](http://measureofdoubt.com/2011/06/22/why-a-vegetarian-might-kill-more-animals-than-an-omnivore/) As vegetarian you generally eat more eggs and dairy products as meat replacements. Unfortunately, more animals are killed to get to the same amount of calories that you'd get from meat. Chickens used for eggs are killed pretty young (and are treated worse than chickens used for meat). For dairy, lots of calves are killed (especially male ones) because they have no economic value apart from their meat.",r1,0.8,0.6,0.9,0.7,0.6,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.9,0.0,0.0,0.8,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.9,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,r2,,
"It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified:

* The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for, either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild. If we're using the usual justification of animal rights - they can feel pain/have a life - then letting them lead a safe and happy life in captivity seems to be more moral than the dangers of the wild.

* This is a less quantifiable good, but zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies.

While I guess the best way to C my V would be to provide overwhelming evidence that zoos provide lower quality of life for the animals than life in the wild and that there are more effective means of conserving/promoting endanger species, I'm mostly interested in values/premises I haven't considered. 

Change my view! :)

It is true that zoos bring animals closer to humans, but there isn't any evidence to show that humans are more caring of the wildlife environment as a result.  



Though, mostly zoo life for animals is a lot like prison life for humans.  No one would argue that a human in prison is alive.  Or that it's not cared for.  Humans have food, shelter, entertainment and social structure.  But all of the things that make life worth living are gone.  The ability to build a family.  The option to find a mate.  The ability to build the things in our lives which we each assign value to.  Animals are not so different.  They might mate with another because they are incited to.

Also, often, the topic of animal depression is discussed in zoos where it would be nearly nonexistant in the wild.

"The title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as slacks and a button down) but would be visible in casual wear (shorts and T-shirt). 

Such a tattoo would not affect chances of college acceptance for three reasons; the ubiquity of tattoos amongst college-aged individuals, the relative unimportance of personal image in the college acceptance process, and the low chance of anyone even seeing the tattoo.

According to a Pew Research Centre report, nearly 38% of college-aged individuals have a tattoo. While that is not a majority by quite a margin, it is a significant amount. Additionally, the popularity and accessibility of tattoos are steadily increasing year by year leading to a greater acceptance amongst a younger crowd. The point here is that because of their widespread nature, tattoos are no longer seen as a sign of rebellion simply because they are so commonplace. 

Furthermore, most colleges prefer to accept or deny students based on their applications alone, rather than on interviews. Unlike a job interview, in which personal image can make or break someone’s chances of getting employment, colleges tend to focus more on scholastic and athletic merit, test scores, and lifetime achievements first. Personal image is last on the docket for a school good enough to conduct personal interviews, if even considered at all. 

The previous two points also assume that a college will know about this tattoo, whereas that may not even be the case. In an interview process, there is no chance that the tattoo will be exposed in formal clothing. If the tattoo is exposed after acceptance, then there is no risk of a college retroactively denying admission based on that alone. 
This third point is also the keystone argument when it comes to employment. For the sake of this argument, I will assume that if an employer knows about any sort of tattoo, it will result in immediately being passed over for the job. This is not consistent with reality and the first two points I make concerning college can be applied to employment as well; tattoos are slowly gaining acceptance in the workforce as the 38% of college students with tattoos graduate and seek employment, and that employers will seek to hire the most qualified candidate with less emphasis placed on personal image. But even discarding these arguments, the possibility of an employer finding out about a tattoo covered by conservative formal clothing in professional situations is nil. 

(As some of you may have guessed, I have posted this because I am considering getting a tattoo and want to make an informed decision before doing so. I think I have carefully considered most ways that a tattoo could impact my life, but I wanted to hear some opposing arguments I may have overlooked and figured Reddit could help me out here)

"Consider a toddler is found to have Down's Syndrome, or Leukemia, or Harlequin-type Ichytosis, or Severe Autism, or Progeria. Every day of their life will be undue suffering for both them and their parents, who have to completely devote their time and money to their hopeless, terminally ill child. Unlike a healthy child, a terminally ill child has no future, no potential, no return on investment for parents. I believe it's best to quietly euthanize an infant with Leukemia before it can fully understand its situation. No child should have to suffer through a living Hell. It would be better to quickly and unknowingly die, than to lucidly suffer a short, miserable existence that gets worse with every passing day. I invite you to CMV.

"I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a 'joke' as angry liberals make it seem.

What I'm trying to say, is that people should not be forced into believing and supporting gay marriage, gay/lesbian/transgender/pansexual and all that—they should be allowed to express their freedom of religion without the oppression of liberalism the way they expect not to be oppressed by conservatism. Seems very hypocritical, no?

The point here, is that staunch liberals have a very high tendency to be hypocritical towards religion, but get really offended when a conservative does the same towards them.

It all makes no sense to me, and I want to be open to changing my belief about this one way or the other. It's a big mess that aggravates me, because no one on the far sides of the spectrum sticks to their word very well. I'm a libertarian, so I have my likes and dislikes toward each side, and I would like to understand these specific viewpoints better.

EDIT: This blew up a lot more than I thought it would, which is good. I got a lot of clarification, and I've awarded some &amp;#8710;'s. To be more specific (if you're trying to step in my shoes), I USED to be a devout Catholic, until I thought some of the teachings were immoral and 'behind the times.' I just don't think that religion is a bunch of crap as some make it out to seem; however, since my view has been changed, I believe that as people should have freedom of religion, that freedom of religion can only go so far before it becomes a legal issue. I believe that freedom of religion already has a more bigoted starting point than the opposite viewpoint which is more 'realistic' shall I say.","People already have freedom of religion.

"In response to this [article](http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a28865/ruby-rose-oitnb/). I believe you can be a man or a woman or trans, and you can be any sexual orientation you want under the rainbow! Every persons orientation is a little nuanced. I don't believe you're gender can be nuanced. You are a man or a woman, whether you were born that way or you underwent physical changes later in life because you knew deep down that you were a man/woman under the skin you were born in. I don't believe you can make a daily choice to identify as a different gender. So you are a girl who hates skirts? You aren't a man because of that, you are just a girl who hates skirts. Not conforming to gender roles doesn't mean that you have the choice to identify yourself as a different gender whenever you please.   
When a trans person switches, they have to jump through all sorts of hoops to legally be a gender. If we recognized ""gender fluidity"" all sorts of problems could arise, such as ""which change room should I use?"". Would it just change depending on how they were feeling that day? Would we all be okay with men, deciding that they are more of a woman today, going into female change rooms and stripping down in front of children?  
I don't believe that people really feel the need to change their genders on a daily basis, and I don't agree with those who would try to force me to respect their ""fluid"" gender. There is already a term for people who don't conform to gender stereotypes and it's androgyny. I consider myself to be a very open person, especially when it comes to other peoples personal choices that don't affect me so please CMV.  
EDIT: u/Paimon has changed my view about gender fluidity being a thing. It's a thing. I still disagree with most of you saying there are no legal or social ramifications though, especially about the change rooms, and on how to address someone who is gender fluid.    
EDIT 2: A lot of people are trying to change my view based on what they think the world should be like (i.e gender neutral bathrooms and change rooms) rather than being realistic about what it actually is (women have to be guarded in order to protect themselves from sexual harassment.) I still don't believe that men with biological man parts should be allowed to waltz into a women's change room because they are feeling like a woman that day, and that I should just trust that they know better than I do what their gender is when their dick is in my face.  
That being said I understand how they is a good term over he/she. It sounds weird to call a girl a they but if someone asked me to refer to them that way, obviously I would. ","Gender is a physical thing. People tend to say things like sex is what is in your pants, and gender is what's in your head. Or that gender is just a social construct (it turns out that sex is also a social construct, but it's a bit complicated, and not part of this post).

So, when someone has an intersex condition they have either ambiguous genitalia, gonads or chromosomes. Currently the brain isn't included in the definition of intersex. That said, there is pretty [strong evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism#Brain_structure) that being trans is a neurological condition. In my opinion it should be considered a congenital neurological intersex condition.

Now, if you read the first few paragraphs you'll find out two things: first, the BSTc is hormone aplastic (it doesn't change shape based on the level of sex hormones), and second, that it doens't differentiate until adulthood, but we have trans people being certain about their gender well before then, so we have to look elsewhere for a cause (at least for early onset gender things).

If the BSTc doesn't change shape, then it's obviously not relevant to genderfluidity, though being part way between the two sizes might account for gender being looser than normal. But what about the parts of the brain that are sensitive to sex hormones and do change based on the pretense or absence of E or T? [This article](http://www.eje-online.org/content/155/suppl_1/S107.full) talks about the parts of the brain that *do* change based on hormone therapy. If someone's brain is not especially solidified because of the aplasitc parts being somewhere in the middle, then slight hormone fluctuations could well switch identity from one side to another. I'm not saying that that *is* how it works, since it's not a thing that has been studied all that much, but it's certainly well within the realm of possibility based on what we do know about gender.

Androgyny is based on appearance, and not identity. Agender is a thing, but it is not the same as gender fluid. Trans people don't or can't always get genital surgery, this doesn't make them any less of a man or woman than any other man or woman with a condition that caused them to lose their genitals. 

The 'man changing in front of little girls' thing is a pretty big stereotype that doesn't really happen. Stalls are a thing, and most gender non-conforming people are well aware of the shape of their bodies, and bladder issues are a pretty big issue for a lot of trans people who have to hold their pee in all day because they can't use public washrooms without the risk of physical assault.

Generally if someone is genderfluid, they'll know you have no way of knowing they are identifying as that day, so they probably won't flip out at you. But you can always ask.","I am by no means an expert, I've just been really interested in gender/sexuality issues for a while and I'll explain it how it makes sense to me. So please if someone is reading this and I am wrong, correct me please!! 

I look at this in 3 categories: sex, gender, and sexuality. I see sex as being your physical situation, sexuality being who you are attracted to, and gender being how you feel inside. Sex, to me, can be male, female, intersex, or any combination thereof. This is fairly straightforward and there aren't many arguments about this, I think.

Sexuality is the next easiest one, and it seems like you understand this one pretty similarly to how I do. A little nuance here is the separation of sexual attraction and romantic attraction, so for example you can want to be romantic with people but totally uninterested in sex (heteroromantic, asexual). These two things are important in defining gender.

I'm gonna talk about transgender people for a minute as a preface to gender. Generally, transgender people have symptoms of gender dysphoria, which is recognized in the [DSM-V](http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf) (it used to be called gender identity disorder until this edition of the DSM), and take steps to alleviate it by either transitioning (hormones, surgery) or presenting (binders, makeup, clothes) as another gender. Transgender people have symptoms of gender dysphoria, and more often than not, they have serious body dysphoria as well,  where they feel disgusted by their bodies or just feeling ""wrong"" in their skin. It's a horrible place to be mentally and can lead to serious depression and self harm. That's why hormone replacement therapy is important, because it tries to eliminate body dysphoria or at least tone it down a few notches. I bring this up because gender fluidity is basically the same thing, except gender fluid people either do not have body dysphoria or they do not experience it to the same degree. They have the same feelings of ""wrongness"" about aligning their gender with their sex, and personally I think this has a lot to do with how pervasive gender roles are in society.  

There are *lots* of classes of gender fluidity, and while some of them are fluid on a day-to-day basis like you described, the more common varieties tend to sit somewhere in the middle. The [Genderbread Person](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2015/03/the-genderbread-person-v3/) (with a more in-depth explanation [here](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/03/the-genderbread-person-v2-0/)) is a really awesome illustration that you can play around with. It's a combination of identity (how you feel) and expression (how you present), using socially defined gender norms of femininity and masculinity.

An important thing to keep in mind is, when we are looking at issues like restrooms or changing rooms, is that individuals who are genderfluid are not ""men going in a women's bathroom"" or ""women in a man's changing room,"" because I feel like that has more of a predatory connotation. It's really up to the individual which one they want to use. In my opinion, changing rooms are not a big deal, but restrooms go by what you present as (ex. if you are a trans-man, you use a stall in the men's restroom). (As mentioned in another comment, gender neutral restrooms are the best way to solve this I think, and more and more public places are starting to implement them which is really awesome!!)

The way I look at it is like, since hormone therapy requires recommendations from doctors and therapists, legally identifying as genderfluid should be managed the same way.",117,"Gender is a physical thing. People tend to say things like sex is what is in your pants, and gender is what's in your head. Or that gender is just a social construct (it turns out that sex is also a social construct, but it's a bit complicated, and not part of this post).

So, when someone has an intersex condition they have either ambiguous genitalia, gonads or chromosomes. Currently the brain isn't included in the definition of intersex. That said, there is pretty [strong evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism#Brain_structure) that being trans is a neurological condition. In my opinion it should be considered a congenital neurological intersex condition.

Now, if you read the first few paragraphs you'll find out two things: first, the BSTc is hormone aplastic (it doesn't change shape based on the level of sex hormones), and second, that it doens't differentiate until adulthood, but we have trans people being certain about their gender well before then, so we have to look elsewhere for a cause (at least for early onset gender things).

If the BSTc doesn't change shape, then it's obviously not relevant to genderfluidity, though being part way between the two sizes might account for gender being looser than normal. But what about the parts of the brain that are sensitive to sex hormones and do change based on the pretense or absence of E or T? [This article](http://www.eje-online.org/content/155/suppl_1/S107.full) talks about the parts of the brain that *do* change based on hormone therapy. If someone's brain is not especially solidified because of the aplasitc parts being somewhere in the middle, then slight hormone fluctuations could well switch identity from one side to another. I'm not saying that that *is* how it works, since it's not a thing that has been studied all that much, but it's certainly well within the realm of possibility based on what we do know about gender.

Androgyny is based on appearance, and not identity. Agender is a thing, but it is not the same as gender fluid. Trans people don't or can't always get genital surgery, this doesn't make them any less of a man or woman than any other man or woman with a condition that caused them to lose their genitals. 

The 'man changing in front of little girls' thing is a pretty big stereotype that doesn't really happen. Stalls are a thing, and most gender non-conforming people are well aware of the shape of their bodies, and bladder issues are a pretty big issue for a lot of trans people who have to hold their pee in all day because they can't use public washrooms without the risk of physical assault.

Generally if someone is genderfluid, they'll know you have no way of knowing they are identifying as that day, so they probably won't flip out at you. But you can always ask.","I am by no means an expert, I've just been really interested in gender/sexuality issues for a while and I'll explain it how it makes sense to me. So please if someone is reading this and I am wrong, correct me please!! 

I look at this in 3 categories: sex, gender, and sexuality. I see sex as being your physical situation, sexuality being who you are attracted to, and gender being how you feel inside. Sex, to me, can be male, female, intersex, or any combination thereof. This is fairly straightforward and there aren't many arguments about this, I think.

Sexuality is the next easiest one, and it seems like you understand this one pretty similarly to how I do. A little nuance here is the separation of sexual attraction and romantic attraction, so for example you can want to be romantic with people but totally uninterested in sex (heteroromantic, asexual). These two things are important in defining gender.

I'm gonna talk about transgender people for a minute as a preface to gender. Generally, transgender people have symptoms of gender dysphoria, which is recognized in the [DSM-V](http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf) (it used to be called gender identity disorder until this edition of the DSM), and take steps to alleviate it by either transitioning (hormones, surgery) or presenting (binders, makeup, clothes) as another gender. Transgender people have symptoms of gender dysphoria, and more often than not, they have serious body dysphoria as well,  where they feel disgusted by their bodies or just feeling ""wrong"" in their skin. It's a horrible place to be mentally and can lead to serious depression and self harm. That's why hormone replacement therapy is important, because it tries to eliminate body dysphoria or at least tone it down a few notches. I bring this up because gender fluidity is basically the same thing, except gender fluid people either do not have body dysphoria or they do not experience it to the same degree. They have the same feelings of ""wrongness"" about aligning their gender with their sex, and personally I think this has a lot to do with how pervasive gender roles are in society.

"Linux is a hard to learn OS and seems daunting for the average Windows user. Many things on Windows cannot be used on Linux (Distros I have tried were Mint and Ubuntu).

1. Gaming. Games such as ARMA 3 or any other DirectX 11 games cannot be played on Linux at all. In fact, Steam refuses to download them. Even some directx 9 games cannot be played using Wine. (personal issues were splinter cell, battlefield (any of them), and SWBF2 to name a few.) 

2. Ease of use. Whenever I try to look up how to do something on Linux it always involves the terminal and confusing commands. With Windows, everything has a easy to use interface. Compared to Windows, Linux is not as polished and requires a lot of setup to easily use. 
Many technologically challenged people have no idea how to use the terminal, especially without Google's help.

3. Drivers. I applaud Linux for its ability to easily recognize system drivers (chipset, USB stuff, etc) but when it comes to things such as joysticks and gaming controllers, even Nvidia drivers and other special drivers (ps3 eye webcam), the terminal has to be used with varying degrees of success. 

4. Applications. Almost every program is Windows only and has no alternative in Linux. Some examples are anything GPU/gaming related, (MSI afterburner, geforce experience, etc.) fan control, temp monitors, and any program that has an exe at the end.
 
In short, the excessive use of the terminal combined with the lack of common programs/drivers make Linux unusable for both the everyday consumer and the gamer.

I am completely willing to change my view, as I have tried Linux many times with the same common issues appearing. I just see no benefit Linux has over Windows, besides being free.

What i see is that while for men sex is a *need*, like hunger and all (a need that doesn't kill us but instead makes us suffer if unsatisfied), for women it's more of a take-it-or-leave-it thing, something they can enjoy but that they don't really need, a nice thing to have but that doesn't really matter much if they don't have it, like, say, chocolate (although women would be far less willing to give up chocolate in my experience).

Determining the value of one human being over another is an inherently sticky problem, especially if you're bringing in the idea of getting rid of those who aren't ""valuable enough"". There are always those who will see particular groups of people as ""less than"" those around them. So who should be granted that wonderful task of determining such a thing? You? What makes you more qualified than others to determine the worth of another person's life, especially if you're not even the one responsible for taking care of it?

What if those in charge of making such decisions started doing so on the basis of race? What about eliminating people who practice particular religions? Sometimes the reason not to do something (like eliminating inconvenient groups of people) isn't because it adds a direct benefit to society to keep them, but because to engage in such an act would make that society less worth living in (because of who that society would require us to be in order to be a part of it).

Your dislike of those who are mentally handicapped is subjective, as are the other examples mentioned here. If I have someone in my family who is mentally handicapped, but feel as though his or her presence adds to the overall quality of our life experiences, who are you to tell us that this family member isn't contributing to our overall well-being? Who are you to decide that this family member of mine should be eliminated simply because it makes you uncomfortable?

Sometimes the act of living in society is itself a social commitment to one another, that in times when we are not at our best requires the people as a whole to maintain an obligation to one another that says we will help to take up the slack in times when we the individual may not always be able to carry the load. It's this social contract to one another that allows us to have a certain level of existential anxiety relieved, because even if we are struggling ourselves, we know that our friends, our family, and sometimes even the society as a whole will help us through.

"Hi.

Whenever I read about people trying to 

- increase the number of women in science or engineering
- increase the number of women in politics
- increase the number of women in positions of power
- increase the number of women that are firefighters or police

I can't help feeling that it is a rather useless cause. I have no problem at all with there being less women than men in any place. What I would (and do) have a problem with is women having it more difficult than men to enter certain professions. That is the real problem we should, as a society, try to solve.

The current approach is ""forcing"" the proportion of women to increase, by means of: 

- gender-specific student grants, 
- positions reserved for women, 
- lower physical requirements,
- etc.

As I see it this kind of solutions are problematic in two ways:

- They involve so-called ""positive discrimination"", which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman. This is absurd and can increase animosity in the male coworkers. Admittedly, that would be wrong on their part, but it still can create an hostile work environment.

- They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. 

The only benefits I see is that ""artificially"" increasing the number of women in certain places may make the presence of women in said place appear less ""unusual"" to society, thereby decreasing the discrimination, but I still think they do more harm than good.

Reddit, change my view!

PD: English is not my first language, so I apologize for any awkwardly phrased sentence I may have written, and welcome any correction. 

EDIT: In only a few hours there have been a lot of great answers that have confirmed my feeling that this was a more nuanced issue that I could even imagine. My view has been changed in that I had underestimated the benefits of this kind of measures. In particular I now see that:

- Artificially increasing the number of women in certain fields makes said fields much less ""threatening"" to other women.
- Makes male coworkers appreciate the capabilities of women, decreasing further discrimination.
- Improves the selection process by eliminating male-favoring biases. Whenever a man less prepared than a woman would have got the position by conscious or unconscious biases a well-prepared woman will get it.

I remain unconvinced that physical tests should have easier versions for women. Most people seemed to agree with me on this, though. I have realized, however, that jobs that at first seem to be mainly physical (police, firefighters, ...) would also benefit from having more women. 

Some of my favourite answers, where you can find studies supporting all of this, are:

"Cigarettes are the leading cause of preventable death, responsible for roughly 480,000 deaths per year in the US. 41,000 of those deaths aren't even those of users -- they are the deaths of those exposed to secondhand smoke. If you use the drug (nicotine), it can directly affect the health of those close to you. 

Smoking harms nearly every organ in the body, causing cancer and disease. Cigarettes are extremely addictive and many people can't quit even if they try.

Yet other drugs pose less threats and have a much lower or even a nonexistent fatality rate. They certainly aren't killing 1,300 people per day. 

Can you imagine if an illegal drug killed over 1,000 people everyday, users and nonusers? There would be political crusades.

For all illicit drugs combined, the number of resulting deaths were about 17,000 in 2013. For all drugs combined -- legal and illegal -- that number jumped to about 46,500 for that same year. That's an extra 29,500 deaths from legal drugs.

Cigarettes cause 10x more deaths per year than all the drugs in the US.

Why are we pouring so much time, resources and money into the Drug War to keep these *super dangerous* illegal drugs out of the hands of the American public such as marijuana (easy argument, 0 deaths) or even heroin (much more difficult argument, ~6,000 deaths in 2013) when cigarettes are so acceptable? 

Cigarettes kill nearly half a million people per year and are the direct cause for serious health issues and reduced lifespan. They are highly addictive. If the objective of the War on Drugs is to keep people safe and not addicted to drugs, how can we rationalize this continuing support of cigarettes while stigmatizing the use of other, less harmful drugs? 

- - -

**Reasons I think we overlook this high fatality rate...**

* culture and ingrained public perception of acceptance. 

Cigarettes used to be advertised as good for you and everybody knows somebody who smokes. Smoking is not something you necessarily have to hide. Jobs don't (generally) screen for cigarette smokers.

* in the eyes of the public, cigarettes aren't really ""drugs"" (i.e. they don't alter your state of consciousness; they don't get you high)

An 18 year old can legally buy as many packs of cigarettes as they want.  In the US, they can't even do that with alcohol (which gets you drunk). In states with legal marijuana, you also have to be 21 to buy/consume. 

* cigarettes don't cause immediate death. (shortsightedness)

You don't overdose on nicotine. Instead, cigarettes slowly kill you so there is no instant connection between cigarettes and death. For example, a heroin OD would be an instant ""drugs kill you."" If you smoke a cigarette, you know you aren't risking your life right that second.

- - -

**What are some other reasons we overlook this fatality rate and continue to socially and legislatively accept cigarettes?**

Maybe your premise is wrong about the objective of the War on Drugs. The War on Drugs came from the Nixon administration, with the *advertised* purpose ostensibly being to keep people safe and not addicted to drugs. But according to John Ehrlichman, who was counsel and Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs under Richard Nixon, the real purpose was different. Here is an excerpt from an interview with Dan Baum for the book ""Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure"":

&gt;The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar Left, and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black. But by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.

According to the book, the rationale for the war on drugs was to target people who were not likely to vote for Nixon: 

&gt;The young, the poor, and the black. Nixon couldn't make it illegal to be young, poor, or black, but he could crack down hard on the illegal drug identified with the counterculture.

If the book is right, acceptance of cigarettes falls in line exactly with the War on Drugs.","I don't disagree with your claim that the war on drugs is stupid (I choose to believe that's your claim, and I agree).  

But to answer your hypothesis about why we're mysteriously okay with cigarettes, it's because it's a lot easier to keep something away from people than it is to TAKE something away from people.  If the default stance on marijuana was already that it was legal, it'd still be legal everywhere and you wouldn't be seeing many people trying to get it banned.  Same as alcohol.  

But when something is *already* illegal, it's a lot easier to keep it that way.  If cigarettes were illegal already, they'd likely be staying that way, for exactly the reasons you mentioned.

"This is something that's always bothered me, all the way back to when I was a kid. I never understood why it was considered polite to say ""bless you"" after someone had sneezed. 

From my understanding, because people believed sneezing was a demon being expelled from your body, they would say ""bless you."" Nowadays, that doesn't really make sense, and I doubt that anybody believes that is the reason people sneeze. 

Now I don't really care if people prefer to say ""bless you"" after they hear someone sneeze, but it's absolutely ridiculous that some people actually get upset, and will even go as far as calling someone out for not saying ""bless you"" after they'd sneezed. They simply had a tickle in their nose and their body was getting whatever particles it didn't want in the nose out. 

Some may say that it's similar to saying ""excuse me"" when they burp, fart, or yawn, but I disagree. Saying excuse me is a way of apologizing for being a disruption, while saying ""bless you"" is a silly way of saying ""I acknowledge that you have sneezed."" 

Saying ""bless you"" doesn't make sense, and while it doesn't hurt to say, I shouldn't be ridiculed for refusing to congratulate someone on their sneeze. It becomes more disruptive than the sneeze itself and it's just silly. 

Please, please CMV. I'm tired of getting shit for not wanting to say ""bless you"" but I'm also too stubborn of an asshole to conform.","Do you use the word ""Goodbye""? Even though it has its etymology from a contraction of the phrase ""God be with ye""?

If you are looking for a perfectly rational reason as to why we say ""Bless you"" after a sneeze, you won't find one. As you have already hear from other people in this thread, it is a cultural carry over from earlier times, and we do it out of convention. 

Similarly, the secular usage of Merry Christmas or Goodbye can be applied to ""Bless you"". You don't have to literally mean that you wish to bless someone in a divine sense, you can apply it as a cultural custom.

Other languages have different words for a post-sneeze polite convention, but none of them are objectively useful.

Gesundheit (German) and Salud (Spanish) both just mean ""health"", so they are a bit more direct to the point. But even then, they don't say ""salud"" when someone coughs, only when they sneeze.

It is an illogical social custom, like many that we have, and you should just conform to it where it benefits you.

"Edit: YOU HAVE CHANGED MY VIEW. (Only regarding hunting for food) 

This isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a bit sadistic. Hear me out - I'm not here to make a dig at hunters. I don't eat meat myself but I actually believe hunting game as a source of meat is much more ethical than eating mass produced factory farmed animals. Game animals have at least had a natural life without chemicals, genetic engineering and is the ultimate in animal welfare. You can't beat having the life nature dictates. So I'm in conflict with what is actually involved in hunting. 
Lets take an example of a hunting a deer. A healthy meat with a plentiful population to chose from. So you go out into its habitat, learn its habits, track it and then finally you see it. Quietly in its happily eating some food. Minding its own business. Full of life and so majestic in its natural habitat. This stunning beast is a pleasure to see.  I believe many hunters genuinely have a lot of respect for the animals they hunt. But then full of all that respect BOOM! They take its life. Just like that. All that effort to understand it, follow it and watch it they extinguished  in a second.  Cold hard logic can indeed justify why the animal is killed but deep down the pleasure hunters feel when they've killed an animal doesn't make sense to me. 
","I'm just starting out hunting, and I've taken some small game, but I don't do it just to see something die, and I hope I never do. I do it because I like the food, I like being outdoors, I like knowing my meat was harvested as painlessly as possible, and in the U.S. it helps prevent habitat destruction by both funding conservation and managing populations that have had their natural predators removed by human intrusion and poor hunting practices prior to the current system. I want future generations to see whitetail deer, water fowl, and wild turkeys, and  can help preserve them by hunting responsibly, while getting some free range organic food out of it. 
Edit: I want to add that when I pull the trigger, I feel a mix of emotions. Seeing something die by your own hands is unpleasant, and I don't get a single bit of pleasure for the act of killing. At the same time, the feeling of accomplishment after spending hours scouting and tracking is a huge rush. I know a lot of hunters say a prayer over their kill, and while I am not religious, I do pause to reflect and respect an animal's passing","I applaud deer hunters in my area because we have way too many deer. Car/deer interactions are high in my former state. I know. I've hit one. Deer populations are out of wack because we removed alpha predators. There are too many of them and the health of the herd is affected. 

Hunters either kill deer or deer populations grow to the point where they starve to death. Nature doesn't really mess around.

"WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that.




Most of the people that I look up to in life and seem to agree with all seem to support abortion. The people I see on the internet are supported for calling out someone who is against abortion, for instance reddit, to support abortion seems to be the widely regarded popular opinion. This probably isn't the best way to put it, but I seem to agree with every other popular political opinion on reddit (I should have thoughts of my own, and shouldn't form my opinions based upon some random website.) I like making fun of racist old assholes, I like making fun if homophobic old assholes, I like making fun of sexist old assholes, and I like making fun of religious old bigots, etc. etc. etc. But abortion seems to be the thing I disagree with, and I kind of feel like an asshole, like I must be missing some key point. I feel terrible that I have the opinion I do, because everyone seems to hate those who have it, and that's why I've come here, I must be missing some sort of point, and I hope that you can point it out for me. At first I just thought I didn't understand the issue well enough, but after I came to understand both sides of the debate, I can't help but wonder why everyone just accepts that a fetus isn't alive, and are kind of ignoring the moral implications of what if it's not? It's not that I think the fetus is necessarily alive, it's more along the lines that I don't think that you can prove that it's not alive (I genuinely don't think we will ever be able to definitively prove it). However I am going to counter my own argument here in saying that you can't prove that rocks aren't sentient either in the philosophical sense, but there is at least reason to believe that a fetus is more alive than a rock. When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality. Now I realize that it's not always consensual sex, and having to carry the child of someone who assaulted you is an absolutely horrendous thing, I would not wish that on my worst enemy, and I don't say that lightly, I really truly wouldn't. I can only imagine feeling as though I would just want to tear the child out no matter what. Never the less, life is life, a fetus is innocent, and the best I can recommend is some extreme therapy taken to whatever (healthy) extent necessary to help a person cope with such a thing. The ""it's going to happen anyway"" mindset I believe is just lazy, there are so many things on this planet that are going to happen anyway, are we just going to let them happen?




Of those who are fine with people having a different opinion, it seems as though the popular opinion among them is that those who are anti abortion should shut up and keep it to themselves, don't bother anyone with it, but to be honest I even disagree with that, I don't get mad at those who picket abortion clinics, I don't see it as a bad thing to do, they literally see abortion as murder, even if you do support abortion, try to get in that mindset, seeing something as murder and being told to shut up and ignore it. (This is also why I don't get mad at animal rights activists, I've seriously considered going vegan, and I kind of think following my own philosophy, it's selfish and hypocritical of me that I'm not.) I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live. We're having two different discussions and getting pissed at each other for not coming to the same conclusion. I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it's not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy. And maybe that's why I don't understand, maybe if it even remotely affected me my opinion would be different. I'm not certain. But please help me change my view, I feel like a total ignorant asshole.






TL;DR: I feel like an asshole for being against abortion

I make it a point to respect opposing beliefs, as long as the belief makes sense and is thought out. I'll rarely respect an argument against gay marriage, because that is discriminatively denying what should be a basic human right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 

Abortion is a very complicated topic, though, and I can understand why someone would be against. Disliking the idea of ending a life before it makes sense is totally fair. I disagree with your position, but I get why you have it.

And your opinion is not an asshole opinion. Unlike prohibiting gay marriage, banning abortion isn't trampling over liberties or discriminating. You could make the argument that it's telling a woman she isn't allowed to have control over her own body, but I'd argue that it doesn't reach the same extent. Now, this is certainly to a degree apples and oranges, and not the perfect comparison, but do you understand what I mean? Furthermore, you admit to yourself that you aren't in a position where abortion would matter to you. You know that you have a lack of perspective shaping your opinion. 

And just because you agree with Redditors on some things doesn't mean you have to agree with them on everything. They're *your* beliefs, and nobody can tell you that if you believe A, you have to also believe B and C. Sure, a party platform might indicate support for all three, but you believe what you want, regardless what other people have outlined. 

You aren't saying women are subordinate beings. You aren't calling pro-choice people heathens. You aren't being a dick about your beliefs. They are thought-out, and you believe them for a reason. And there's nothing wrong with that.

I disagree with it, but I won't attempt to change your view on abortion. But you *are* wrong about feeling like an asshole for it. ","I honestly don't know anyone who is pro abortion. It's a sad and traumatic thing to choose to do, and I'm not sure it's something I would ever choose for myself. 

But not for one second do I think my choice not to have an abortion should affect someone's hard choice to have one.

When is it okay to limit a woman's right to do as she wishes with her own body? 

A women's right to control her reproductive organs should not end the moment someone sticks a penis inside her. 

It shouldn't end when he ejaculates, it shouldn't end just because she happens to be ovulating, or because an egg is inseminated. So when should her rights be limited with respect to her choice to abort the pregnancy? When should the rights of a fetus outweigh her right to choose her own destiny? 

Obviously by the time she gives birth, that fetus has full rights to life. But when did they start? Did the child's rights to life gradually come into being, or were they switched on suddenly?

I think that the fetus should only be deemed to have rights when it could theoretically survive even if the mother tragically died.  Only at this point do I see any point in supporting a fetus' rights. Before this it is too much a part of its mother to survive on its own and therefor too much a part of its mother to have rights separate from hers. 

So do I support abortion? No. Do I support it being legal? Absolutely!

"This is fairly straightforward.  I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property.  It should not matter what the use of the property is, or who lives there.  If you own a plot with a value of $300,000, you should pay the same tax as any other owner of a plot valued at $300,000.

The most egregious example against this to me is [California prop 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_13_\(1978\)) which freezes property taxes when you buy a house, essentially subsidizing long-term residents at the cost of more recent arrivals.

The basic reasoning for this is twofold.  First, there's a fairness question, since the taxes you pay should be the same no matter who you are.  In the case of property taxes, they're already progressive in as much as they depend on the fair market value of an asset you own. 

Second is an efficiency issue.  Giving people tax abatements encourages them not to move (as in prop 13) or to not sell when they don't have good use for the property, such as [this woman who is being sued for failing to maintain a property she can't afford to renovate, but keeps paying the very low taxes on.](http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150817/central-harlem/owner-of-dilapidated-landmarked-harlem-home-sued-rare-move-by-city)

I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates.  If you want hard questioning, or to know their stand on the issues, interviews from journalists can do that.  Debates are just grandstanding and ""gotchas.""  

A crisis simulation on the other hand would be really useful for getting information about how candidates would do the job of President.  We would see how they asses a situation, how they handle disagreeing advisors, and how deep their knowledge of government runs.

This is also a technique used in a lot of other situations to train and evaluate people who will hold a lot of responsibility.  If you want to be an astronaut, you're going to be doing a lot of simulations.

As far as getting candidates to do it, I could see this being something that a somewhat more obscure candidate does as a way to generate publicity, and which might catch on.   Probably not for the major party candidates for this election cycle, but maybe in the future.

As far as I can tell, this method is far more likely to highlight the shortcoming of a candidate's abilities than the standard debates. I can't see any candidates (except the fringe ones) being masochistic enough for something like this. An additional problem is that since they're on camera, they still wouldn't behave the way they would in a real situation. They know this, and so do we.

The WaPo article still stresses that it'll be the journalists who analyze the simulation results for everyone else. How does that remove the ideological bias that's present in the current system?

* **Evaluation of successful simulation**

This is a big one. A lot of these situations would have to deal with emergency scenarios, not long-term matters. So perhaps it would be useful to see how a candidate handles a shooting at an Army base, but it tells us nothing about their ability to negotiate with Iran.

Then they hop in the ""Iran is about to get a nuclear bomb"" simulator. They both draft potential agreements to put forth to Iran and other countries. What now?

"This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation i have come to.

The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) is a sign of human weakness in a couple of ways. 

The need for an afterlife in most religions satisfies our general fears of death, and the impermanence and futility of our lives. The theory isn't backed by much scientific evidence as far as i know, so the reason to believe in an afterlife isn't that it makes more sense but that it makes life easier. A fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that i would categorize as fairytale. This is what i would call a weakness. 

The need for moral guidance in life - to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong. Furthermore, the need of a consequence by eternal damnation as persuasion not to do ""bad things"", and the need of an incentive by eternal salvation to do good. Is a sign of weakness in that it shows that human-nature is bad, or barbaric in a sense.


EDIT: Keep the comments coming guys - ""i'll secede on that point - ""moral guidance"" is not evidence for human weakness. But a motivation to believe in a creator.""

That's incorrect. Humans have a limited attention span. Making things easier allows you to better focus on important tasks.

So here you're saying artificially produced reward and punishment schemes are unhelpful and demonstrate barbaric behaviour?

Also incorrect, humans are rational intelligent beings and it's fairly normal for them to create artificial incentive structures to aid proper behaviour, like golden stars for doing well at class, or setting artificial goals like having a bookshelf of a favorite author.

None of your stated weaknesses are actual weaknesses. There are religious groups with genuine weaknesses like jehovah's witnesses who refuse to take blood transplants, or the Hindu practice of followers of the Vishnu Smriti burning widows, but vague non weaknesses don't mean much. If a weakness leads to physical harm then it's a bit more serious, but vague emotional ones mean little.

There are many practices of religious people that humans in general do. Religious people speak. This isn't a sign of their weakness at nonverbal communication. Religious people exercise. This isn't a sign they are wasting calories. Religious people read. This isn't a sign of their lack of sociability.

"Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 

1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit whiny, perhaps because is is too close to ""why.""

2. Exclusivity. Only about 300 words in English start with X. Y starts over 700 (per Wolfram-Alpha, and this appears to include proper nouns). X appears in only 0.15% of English words, while Y appears in far more. I could not find an estimated percentage, but so many adverbs end in ""ly"" that it rather proves my point. Even though it's so exclusive, it is so much more versatile, as shown below.

3. Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind. 

4. Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4). 

5. Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable. 

6. Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze. 

7. Sex. Our favorite word not only has X right in it, but the whole last 2/3 of the word sounds like saying X. Y? Nowhere to be found, unless it tags along to make something sexy. Not to mention the uses of XXX, and the fact that fairer sex is made up of X chromosomes. Y gives us baldness, hairy backs, and emotional immaturity. 

8. History. Malcolm X, not Malcolm Y. There's even ""American History X.""

9. Versatility in other areas. X can be used to show that something is crossed out, used as a check mark to indicate the choice on a form, used in cartoons to show that a person is dead, used in medicine (x-rays), used to show treasure on a map, 

10. = X. 

11. ~~No one has ever died in a state spelled with an X. Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, and Wyoming combine for 10% of the deaths in the US each year~~ I somehow came up with the 4 Y states off the top of my head and also thought there were no X states. New Mexico and Texas. 

12. If you're talking about unknown items, you always say ""X is better than Y,"" never ""Y is better than X"". 


EDIT: It worked. I was forced to rethink some of my strongest points. I still may think that X is better, but I can see that Y has its merits and can sometimes be even superior. Very clever responses in many cases, and I'm afraid I'll be banned for giving out too many deltas to people who make me rethink each point.

"It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing which I believe is important and not many people are talking about is *cultural influence*. I'm not talking about GDP or lobbying power, I'm talking about blue jeans, pop music, the idea of social mobility, emancipation and suffrage for all. These are all concepts born in the West and exported all around the world, causing social changes in the cultures of the countries they take root in. More and more young Japanese are breaking off from their country's own traditions to follow Western culture, before their radicalization (also, unfortunately, facilitated by the West) blue jeans and pop music was taking the Middle East by storm, African nouveau riche seek to emulate the Western businessman lifestyle ideal of sleek cars and fat cigars. The whole *idea* of the Western way of life has bled into the cultures of countries all over the world, and has likely changed them almost irrevocably.

However, I cannot see that the same thing has happened with regards to China. The biggest cultural exporter in the East as far as I can see is Japan, despite its smaller economy and shrinking population: people still can't get enough of Manga and anime, of Japanese fashion (the trendier edge of which is mainly a Japanese take on Western fashion), of Japanese cuisine, of the whole idea of the Japanese society as one of politeness and civility in any situation. Heck, even Japanese bands are some of the most globally popular Eastern bands (though South Korea might take the crown with regards to this one after PSY).

The point I'm making is that apart from cuisine, I cannot see of any real cultural impact Chinese culture has had on the rest of the world, especially when compared to the influences of Western culture as well as Korean and Japanese culture. Because of this, I find it hard to take China seriously as a social threat, although politically and economically I accept that they are strong.","I believe that what you are referring to is called Soft Power (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power). You can oppose it to hard power where a country spreads its influence through economic or military power.
The US and Europe have historically used both: soft power is the cultural influence you're referring to and hard power would be colonialism (amongst other methods)

China has hard power: The US is highly dependent on their economy and they can dictate terms in many industries (lobbying as you mentioned).
My point is that perhaps as a westerner, you won't be appealed by their lifestyle now, but further down the road, other generations might be.
Your example of African nouveau rich is my counter argument:
First, Europeans colonized Africa with hard power, and many generations later, Africans have started to be influenced by Europeans' soft power (cars and cigars).

"I've been studying Linguistics as an undergraduate for about 8 months or so now, so this one is important to me academically. In discussions of language, there are typically two camps into which people fall: prescriptivism, and descriptivism. Prescriptivists, think your typical grammarian, David Crystal, Lynne Truss, etc., correcting people's grammar, getting fussy about punctuation, insisting upon proper pronunciation. At the heart of prescriptivism is the idea that there is a way that language *should* be spoken. Descriptivism, on the other hand, argues that there is no such thing as ""correct"" language, that what prescriptivists call ""mistakes"" are just non-standard varieties, and that we shouldn't ever make judgements about people's language.

Linguistics is whole-heartedly and almost exceptionlessly (AFAIK) descriptivist, and as a student, I recognise its importance. The view that there is any single ""correct"" variety of language is obviously misleading from the beginning: which variety? Who says X dialect is better than Y dialect? And judgements against language, I-believe-it-was-Peter Trudgill argued, are actually judgements against people's social class, as supposedly ""incorrect"" language features are often described by the upper classes as being used by the lower classes. And I do mostly agree with it.

But. While I understand all this, I find it difficult to truly shake off the claws of prescriptivism. In particular, the idea that there isn't any ""correct"" language. For example:

""He _went_ to the shops""
""He _gone_ to the shops""

I can accept that in some English dialects, the past participle of ""go"" is ""gone"" instead of ""went"". That's not a mistake. But then take a sentence like:

""Shops went the he to""

This isn't syntactically valid: it doesn't parse as a sentence. You might just be understood, but more likely you would confuse everybody with this sentence, so it fails as communication. If this sentence both isn't a valid sentence, and can't be understood, what other word to describe it than ""incorrect""? It can't be a valid form of language if almost nobody understands it, surely.

So what I'm really seeking, is to understand how sentences like the above can fit into the framework of descriptivism, and for someone to convince me that we can't describe sentences like the above as ""wrong"". Please VCM.

"so random battles that just happen with no warning, while you're walking, just like, warpy screen, you're in a battle now stuff. this really only applies to turn based games, in fact, i don't know of any real time games that have this system of enemy encounters. i don't think they have the need. 

it's annoying as hell. you take 4 steps after getting out of a battle, and arrive in another one that the run functino won't work for and you start taking damage, and then you can't escape again so you take more damage, and that just starts a whole snowball of ""oh my god fuck this shit."" meanwhile, the battles themselves are just often an unnecessary, repetitive, near useless way to grind. the millionth time we saw a zubat in pokemon, it. it wasn't really doing anything for us.

with an rpg game, the logic seems simple enough, i guess - there's a turn based system of combat, and there needs to be a way to trigger the combat screen from the overworld. and it shouldn't necessarily be purely predictable, should it? the player needs to progress and level up so they can meet their bigger challenges in the future. putting aside the discussion about other games mechanics and why in some cases it works much worse than others - there's just better, non annoying ways of doing that now. off the top of my head, paper mario on n64 had visible enemy mobs walking around. if you collided with them, you started a battle. that makes *much* more sense. it's not annoying. it doesn't happen every five steps. it doesn't come out of nowhere. it still accomplishes the same purpose that random encounters do. invisible enemies starting a 5 second battle transition, with a chance that you can't run, especially if you're in over your head and trying to get out of an area, with no ability to see it coming, no warning, no possibility of avoiding it, is just, bad. especially when even something like the paper mario system exists. at least that way, if you have no items, and are on your way back to somewhere because you're too injured, you have a chance of maybe avoiding the enemy mobs.

"Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on to the next news story and give the subject little other thought.  I think that watching these videos would have a much greater impact on people and make them more likely to do something to help.  Personally, if I watch videos like this I feel sick and it disturbs me for about half a week.  I cannot forget about them easily.  Just reading about these events does not have this effect and I can forget about the issues relatively quickly.

Secondly I am sure some people cannot visually imagine how horrific these events are.  Being exposed to footage of it will be a shock and a wake up call to how bad life can be for some people.  This in turn will make them more likely to take action.

I will make it plain that I do not think people should be viewing these sorts of videos for entertainment of any kind.

Finally it seems I am not alone, [this article](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/sean-penn-watches-isis-beheading-videos-out-of-moral-obligation-the-problem-is-we-are-not-seeing-enough-of-real-violence-10127603.html) may help you understand my argument better than I can express it.

EDIT:  Some of the responses have made me realise that what I am suggesting would have different effects on different people and as such viewing these videos may not always cause people to act in a positive way as it has with me.

"Generally speaking, you have two sides on the ""Fat Debate"": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, with either benign or malicious intentions.

First of all, I don't buy HAES. I believe that anyone of any size can be *healthier* at that size. If I start jogging once a week, I probably won't lose weight, but I'll be a teeny-tiny bit healthier and that's good. 

Secondly, BMI is an overall population indicator. There are of course given people who are overweight who are healthier than given people who are within normal range. Same goes for given people who are underweight vs people in normal range. However, I would state that *in general*, the further you slide on the scale from 22.5 in either direction, the further you're getting from optimal.

However, wherever people lie on that scale - underweight -&gt; optimal -&gt; fat is none of your fucking business whatsoever.

You are not a stakeholder in a stranger's health and people would do well to keep their mouths shut about other people's appearance. If you *are*  stakeholder in their health (and this is exclusively limited to loved ones and the person's healthcare practitioners) then maybe you get to say something. *Maybe*.

The best analogy for this is smoking. I smoke and am slightly overweight (~10lb) and it is certainly the smoking that is more detrimental to my health than the few extra pounds.

I *know* that smoking is bad for me - I'm not an idiot. I view the HAES as a bit like ""Healthy No Matter How Much You Smoke"". It's not true, it may even be damaging. On the other hand, encouraging hardened smokers to run around despite being smokers ain't a bad thing. Attack the campaign, if you must, but leave the people alone.

It does not matter how many people tell me that smoking is bad for me. Their statements are uninvited, irritating and will do precisely nothing to change my habits. They may even reinforce them. 

It is *none* of their business if I smoke.

You know when you're eating pizza and you have that one vegan health nut friend who tells you about how pepperoni is full of carcinogens and dairy will cause all kinds of damage to you? That, **at best** is what fat shamers come off like.

I'm not saying there shouldn't be public health campaigns (much like we have anti-smoking campaigns), just that YOU PERSONALLY should never say a damn thing about a stranger's weight, EVER. 

*EDIT: Good discussion, guys. I'm going on a delta spree now, because as /u/ThereOnceWasAMan put it: ""OPs view is that ""others' weight is none of your business"", not ""you shouldn't shame people for being overweight"". They are annoyingly correct in that that is how I *should* have phrased it. 

*EDIT 2*: Work has come up and I have to run off for the evening. I'll come back to this to give ∆s to the deserving. Sorry for the delay!

Don't bully fat people, kids. It helps no one.

"To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting there, what I have observed in my school's mathematics system shows that these skills rely heavily on memorization and calculation, much less on reasoning, and virtually none on application. I've looked at the Common Core website and seen that these accurately reflect the standards put out.

Let's take the [Common Core Algebra standards](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSA/introduction/) as an example. If you scroll down to the Overview, you see that almost all of the skills listed are to solve equations or something of that sort. This is calculation. Common Core currently spends too much time on this, something relatively easy such that computers can do it. Some of this time needs to shift to the other branches of mathematics.

I believe that algebra, as well as much of the rest of mathematics, should be used as a medium through which logic and reasoning are taught. Though computers can use logic to some extent, the human brain is much more capable and should be used for what it is needed for. [Here is a purely algebraic problem.](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/1981_AHSME_Problems#Problem_30) Despite the concepts being purely algebraic, it requires high levels of critical thinking and reasoning in order to solve. This is the type of multi-step problem that should be taught in high schools, but is almost always not. Common Core does not require students to display this level of critical thinking.

Let's take [Geometry for another example.](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSG/introduction/) If you scroll down to the Overview, these standards are somewhat better, since they introduce the notion of proof. However, on close inspection of the Congruence section, only a few basic proofs spanning a few basic proof types are necessary. These do not cover the important proof by contradiction and proof by induction, two kinds of reasoning that can be much better applied to the real world. It is also never required that the student prove any algebraic concepts, such as the quadratic formula. Most theorems in Geometry and all in Algebra are not proven, and the student is forced to memorize them. We have computers for that. We need people to prove and reason.

It’s also important for concepts like Geometry to be taught in conjunction with other areas of mathematics, such as Calculus. I took Geometry in 8th grade, and though that is a bit early for Calculus, the idea of limits and things like that should have at least been touched upon. Why is it that the volume of a pyramid is Bh/3? The idea of taking some function to the limit makes it easy to prove this. Common Core does not cover this.

So far, I’ve touched very little upon the idea of application, and mostly because that’s the most difficult one. We know that mathematics is applied in all sorts of STEM subjects, but what if the student is already set on taking a liberal arts major? They shouldn’t be forced to study engineering with math. So, I think that the application of mathematics needs to brought back to its roots, being the application of logic. Programming is great way to apply this, and though maybe math class isn’t the right place for this, every student already has a programmable graphing calculator anyway. Instead of forcing students to not use programs on tests like they do at my school, I think that the use of programs should be encouraged, since they demonstrate understanding of the basis behind all mathematics, which is logic. Maybe this is straying a bit far from the purpose of Common Core, and it shouldn’t be implemented as a guideline, but perhaps as a suggestion it would be great.

I’ll be going through Common Core for a few more years, and I want to know if it’s effective. Please CMV.


EDIT: Forgot to mention that I think reasoning is much more important than having formulas memorized for the real world.

It is true that the algebra standards make heavy reference to different types of functions but this is because that's a large part of what algebra is, even at the most advanced level. I recommend reading your own links more closely:

* **Interpret** the structure of expressions
* Use polynomial identities to **solve problems**
* Create equations that **describe relationships**
* **Understand solving equations as a process of reasoning and explain the reasoning**

These are just the content standards. Then there are the practice standards, which are literally a description of high-order mathematics:

* Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
* Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
* Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.
* Model with mathematics.
* Use appropriate tools strategically.
* Attend to precision.
* Look for and make use of structure.
* Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

Now, I don't know where you go to school and I have heard some horror stories about the terrible implementation of these standards in some places, but the problem that you propose as an example of a 'good' problem would fit in quite well in the ideal CC algebra classroom.

I could say similar things about the geometry standards. THe key point here is that standards are for TEACHERS. They tell us what themes are important and what general skills we need to teach you. They do not say anything about what STUDENTS do in our classrooms.

I teach high school physics, and I have been spending my time worrying about NGSS, the science version of common core that is implemented next year.

The thing that tends to be annoying about the standards, is that the outright objectives are not really all you need to understand how they are used in the classroom. This is a process that teachers are going through, that frankly due to politics is being rushed. That being said, it seems like your focus is that there is too much memorization and route calculation in CC, and from what I have seen that is far from the case.

You mention calculators and memorization, many AP science classes have recently undergone revision using the same guiding philosophies as CC and NGSS, and they have changed to allow the calculator and equations sheets for the whole test rather than only part.

CC has some issues, namely the testing is happening too quickly, some of the standards for elementary need to be adjusted to fit children's development better, and they need 6-8 years before they will be fully effective, but in most cases they are far and away better than what states had before.

I almost forgot, the site you were looking at is designed for students and parents, which makes it difficult to see exactly what all of that means put together. [Here](http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ils/math/standards.htm) is how Illinois is presenting them to teachers. If your concern is that there are too many ""plug and chug"" questions, that is the old curriculum, CC was designed as a push back against simple 1 step questions and memorization.

If you like, I can try giving better examples from the next gen science standards and the AP Physics redesigns. They all come from roughly the same educational research, I am just more familiar with the nuances of them.

"It all sound the same to me. And to be clear, I know this is what people tend to say about any music they don't ""get."" People say this about rap -- it's just noise, etc. But I like rap, and I think you can make a pretty good argument that there's a ton of variety in rap. From voice to lyrics to production to rhythm, there's really no reason to say Aesop Rock sounds like Mobb Deep, or a track off Illmatic sounds like a Drake mixtape.

I like a lot of types of popular music but don't like punk/hardcore. I looked up hardcore on wikipedia and it seemed like the songs had to fall within a pretty narrow range of genre conventions: short length, driving bass rhythm, simple chords, heavy distortion, shouted lyrics.

So my question is: what does a punk/hardcore fan listen for? What kind of stuff makes a good punk song if the songs are very similar in key respects, or am I missing the boat and there's a lot of variety out there?

"On a hair dryer: ""Do not use in a shower."" If somebody's dumb enough to use a hair dryer in the shower, they're not going to pay much attention to a warning label! Really those things only exist because corporations are so afraid of frivolous lawsuits that could have been avoided if the consumer had only applied common sense in the first place. (Those lawsuits just drive up costs for everybody else, but that's a whole another story.) So I say corporations should be allowed to remove warning labels that would be obvious if one applies common sense without fear of litigation when Darwin strikes again.","- A lot of companies are not afraid of *frivolous* lawsuits.  There have already been *successful* lawsuits (meaning the courts found merit in litigating them.)  The basis of the label is therefore something that has already occurred and cost another company (or companies) significant amounts of money.

- A lot of companies know they're on the hook for ""foreseeable use.""  Therefore they try to anticipate likely use of their products by people, regardless of the wisdom of that use.  It's a lot easier and less costly to preempt dumb use than to make your case (at the expense of litigation) at court.

- The cost of litigation has become so high that most companies end up settling out of court either with a regulatory agency's enforcement branch or a private litigant.  There's also a public policy preference for settlement (or dispute resolution where applicable.) Thus there are fewer opportunities to even make your case, at least not cost effectively, and it's better to rigorously self-police.

- Consumer product safety laws.  The FDA, FTC, FCC, CPSC, and a number of other regulatory agencies require companies to put certain labels on their products, even ""obvious"" ones.  Some of these are obvious because the labels have become so ubiquitous that we now associate that characteristic *because* of the label.

- Minimization of harm.  Usually one cannot sue until they've been harmed, or else there is nothing for the court to remedy.

"I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do.

Every child growing up seems to desire coffee, but only because it's age restricted, similar to alcohol/tobacco. Now I don't have a PhD in psychology or anything, but there is evidence beyond proof that people want what they can't have. It's just human nature, and I feel like it's what's behind the longterm desire for coffee in that something I was once barred from is now freely enjoyed and encouraged. It doesn't help that many people jack their cups with sugars and creams which at a certain point require speculation as to which substance is actually fueling your perceived energy boost.

I consider myself to be very openminded, especially when it comes to substances put into the body for recreational purposes (I'll leave it at that) but I can't seem to see eye-to-eye to my friends that have been religiously trying to convert me all these years.

The extent of my coffee experience would be instant coffee growing up at home (parents weren't 'connoisseurs' by any iteration of the term but were both pretty addicted to), pretentious (shots fired) coffee shops that my fiends would literally drag me to, and the occasional tinder date Starbucks run in which I would just end up getting the vanilla bean frappe 90% of the time, which is delicious by the way.

It seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.

Could that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee? Has my past experienced not done justice to an entire culture that is coffee? I mean people spend hundreds of dollars a year on it, and for what?

"**Edit:** I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas. 

Thanks

I don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. 

Suppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a ""creep"" for ""looking through"" her profile. 

I'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have ""good old days"".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as ""creeping someone's profile"" online. Putting aside when a ""profile"" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. 

So the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...

I feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them.

"I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think scientists would respond if something did happen that disproved the uniformity of nature. I believe if something suddenly changed, scientists would acknowledge this change and attempt further investigation into why this change was possible. I do not believe that scientists would simply outright deny that a change has happened, which is what I think they would do if they simply assumed the uniformity of nature.

"I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are far from north american culture. You're expected to not reveal too much when dressing. I completely understand that everyone has the right to dress how they want to but I just don't feel like if you are giving yourself to your SO then you shouldn't let others see your body.

 To me it is just a very special thing between two people to let the other person see and explore each other that no one else has. Too much cleavage or wearing no bras with thin shirts that let you clearly see the nipple and then she hugs other people makes me feel very uncomfortable. I would love to change my view, as I stand by the right that anyone can wear whatever they want, but this idea is just so integrated in my head after all my life living in it that I can't seem to shut it off
","First of all, this is not a VIEW.
You would never say to your girlfriend, ""You should not wear revealing clothes"". You seem like a rational guy. [Otherwise why would you be here?]

It is a feeling of discomfort, due to inexposure to women wearing such clothes. There was a time when I was uncomfortable with the idea of having a girlfriend who has had sex with someone else.

Remember, our sexuality is not a commodity that we withhold to reveal to our 'special partner'. Sure, it's cute. You two can be like ""see, this is so special to me and I only let you see it. That's how special you are!"", it makes for a great, romantic, childishly sweet 'made for each other' story for the couple, and it gives off a vibe of the relationship being 'truly cemented and committed', like a physical sign of love - [kind of like having a child together as a sign of love]. But YOU decide what your sign of love will be - the sight of her body, or your heart. These rules are not made in heaven. These perceptions are man-made. So YOU decide what you owe to each other.
That 'commodity', is the heart. And the heart only.

When she makes love to you, tells you that you matter the most to her [besides other really important people like parents maybe], that she wants to grow old with you, have a child that is part you and part her[ain't that special?], kisses you on the forehead, lets go of all inhibitions and opens her world to you, THAT, is the special thing you want. 

When a women hugs someone, she is NOT thinking about her sexuality. The person who is getting hugged, is NOT thinking about her sexuality. So why should you worry?

Try watching videos of strong-minded women who look like they really love their partners but wear 'skimpy' clothes. You will realize that a woman is so, so much more than her thighs and cleavage.

And remember - most probably only you will get to see her naked when and during she is in love with you. How about that. You're gonna have your special 'tickle' time anyway.
 
","Okay OP, I might have an answer for you. If you truly want to change your view it's going to take a while and even then it might still not be fully changed.   
So you say you believe that people should be able to wear what they want. That's good, as all people should have that right. Now the biggest issue that you have with it is that it makes you feel uncomfortable. Now I can't make you not feel uncomfortable seeing your hypothetical girlfriend wearing revealing clothing outdoors, only you can.  
  
Being uncomfortable with what your SO wears I think stems from jealousy. You feel that only you should have the right to see that part of your SO. But that's not how the world works these days. You need to invest some trust into your hypothetical SO and realize that you're the only man she wants to be with. Now why would a person with a SO wear revealing clothing? Because it could just be there style, or it makes the feel good about themselves. But you need to try and not be so possessive of your hypothetical SO, they are a person too and they are going to do what they want. And if you're dating someone you should have enough respect for them to let them wear what they want, because when it comes down to it you don't control their actions.   
  
  
Now to change your feelings, the only solution that I have for you is honestly, to buck up. Changing an opinion that is ingrained into you culture is incredibly hard, but it is possible. I had to change how I felt uncomfortable with wearing certain things or discussing certain topics. And though it felt wrong when I did it, the more I kept at it the less wrong it felt. And about after 4 months I found that my feeling on the matter had changed. So if you want to change how you feel, you have to let your SO wear what they want. And if you don't want to change that's fine, but I personally would find an overly jealous SO to be undesirable.

"I submit that Nye's public perception of 'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one 'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before he was every famous. Beyond that, he's just been a guy on TV reading from a script.

Even working at Boeing, his primary job was that of a TV persona: he made the training videos. 

I feel that Obama's use of Nye regarding global warming is strictly an appeal to the populace who grew up watching a kid show, not the opinion of a professional with a background in anything remotely related to climate. This doesn't mean I disagree with what he said, but only disagree with the idea that he should be trusted 'as a scientist'. He's a PR tool in that regard. He only parrots others' research - in everything he's done -not anything he actually observed through his own research. 

Further, simply having a degree in a scientific background makes you aware of that background (he has a bachelor's in *engineering* from Cornell), but that doesn't make you a scientist in the field. I know many people with degrees in one field who work in an entirely different field. A law degree doesn't make you a lawyer, for instance. My father has one and he's a retired contractor: never worked a legal case in his life. Nye's background hardly applies to the vast majority of his TV demonstrations and appearances.

And to the point of Carl Sagan, Neil Tyson, and others: these are actual scientists who have been published, who do(did) research in the field of their degree and beyond. Yes, these men are TV personas, but unlike Nye they're actually also scientists. 

So? Change my view. He's one of my childhood heroes too, but I simply can't accept him as a scientist. I feel that cheapens real work by real scientists.

Edit: [Delta awarded](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bf41n/cmv_bill_nye_is_not_a_real_scientist_in_any/cslnyww), albeit not in a way I had in mind. It's technically correct, [but we all know...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo)

To many of the comments: 

- Education is important and admirable, but that still doesn't make you a scientist in my view. If that's the standard of calling oneself a scientist while being displayed on news media as an expert to be listened to, then really, there's no measure for what an expert is in that regard.  

- There are many qualified scientists who are also good on TV: I still assert Nye's appearances were heavily caused by his association as the funny lab-coat and bow-tie 'science guy' and childhood memories, which is a manipulative and deceptive thing to do when appearing in support of public policy (regardless of my agreement and my own support of the same policy). That deception was not unintentional, but calculated. Herein lies my problem and reasoning for this post. I should note that this still stands as my view, and the delta awarded was awarded basically because I worded the post in a particular way. If anyone would like to address this view, I'd award another delta if the mods are okay with it. 

- I really, honestly think that comparing Nye and people like Neil Tyson and Carl Sagan is an insult to the latter two. That's like comparing your high school bio teacher to the same two men. That's utterly absurd in my mind: Tyson and Sagan contributed more to their fields than Nye ever could at this point. 

- Nye's only contribution I can see, which is the reason for the single delta awarded thus far, has been in the development and design of a hydraulic pressure resonance suppressor used for 747s, to this day. I concede this is a meaningful, scientific advancement for the public made by Bill Nye. ","A scientist is an expert in a science. I think that's a fair definition of  scientist we could agree to.

I was, am and will be a dyed-in-the-patchouli liberal. I was ecstatic that gays can get married now. I will call Caitlyn Jenner whatever SHE wants me to. I'm a big fan of Bernie Sanders. I absolutely believe all fortysomething of Bill Cosby's accusers.
That said, I'm starting to feel a little lost. I cringe when I see the word ""thinkpiece."" I hate that people get so caught up in a perpetual outrage machine and so high off their own self-righteousness they will destroy a life like Justine Sacco's (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html?_r=0) for sport. (Also, how great is Sam Biddle for basically admitting he'd do it all over again for ""the clickz?"") I have to believe that the right or, ""The Man,"" are absolutely loving this infighting. Endless digital ink is spilled on Black Widow in The Avengers while cops are still shooting anyone with a skin tone darker than Burnt Sienna.

Am I wrong? Am I the asshole here? Is all of this of vital importance? Will the 24/7/365 internet analytical news cycle bring us to the promised land? Or is this just a tool of cultural commentators on a deadline?

EDIT:  I'll add this since I'm getting a lot of advice to get off twitter.  I definitely don't go on as much as I used to, but it's hard for me to stay off completely for two reasons.  One, there's a lot of actually good, funny twitterers out there.  It's also a good news source, it's how I found out we got Bin Laden.  Two, as someone who, despite all warning signs, wants to be involved someday in the comedy/entertainment biz, it's kinda necessary for those on the come up to use it as a promotional tool.  If I was Spielberg or Tarantino I'd get the hell off, trust me.  But I'm a nobody from nowhere at the moment.

Try not to focus on the Twitter thing as much.  There's pieces on Gawker, WaPo and Daily Dot that I've used for examples.  Here's a piece on the AVClub where the writer complains about female fans of Captain Marvel for... reasons.  Not sure.  They're problematic somehow.

http://www.avclub.com/article/marvel-learned-wrong-lessons-carol-corps-218003

EDIT 2:  Not sure how much longer this'll stay active, or how much I'll be able to check in tomorrow so I'll do a pseudo-wrap up here.  I used mainly examples from the comedy world and Twitter since that's what immediately came to mind.  Other examples I could've used were Donglegate (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/) and ScientistShirtgate (http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/11/18/scientist-shirt-feminism-comet-your-say/19248543/).  I think those two, and there are others, are also worthy of discussion in that they involve nuance.  Someone like Donald Trump, that's a black-and-white case of racism.  

Someone in the comments said this seemed like neurotic hand-wringing by an alienated individual, and that could very well be the case.  I didn't really spend a whole lot of time making a comprehensive essay about this because a-it's just reddit and b-I posted from the gut with immediacy.  If someone wants to take this theme and do it up better, by all means go for it.  I never claimed to be a social scientist.  Or even just social.

Some good opinions here, with the major consensus being that these things seem big and important on the internet where everything is a hot take and people are either Lawful Good or Chaotic Evil with no in-between.  So in stepping out from the cyberspace will keep the perspective in check.

Good talk everyone!  No name calling or trolling!

"I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in top movie list rankings. I am a westerner who has had exposure mainly to western film but also enjoys many other film types and cultures including Japanese and anime film.

However, I don't much care for Studio Ghibli stuff. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I don't like it. Except for Hisaishi's music, which I think is beautiful. I don't know why everyone seems to like these films so much. 

It bothers me as lots of my other views in life are congruent with the norm, or I can see why they vary.

I've watched lots of Ghibli films in order to give them a chance. I've already heard lots of people arguing that the artwork is great (and I do agree it is) and that's what makes the film great, but that doesn't cut it for me; the same people who argue in this way don't seem to apply that logic to the other films they watch and so must be adapting their viewing style for Ghibli or just repeating something they heard somewhere else, not responding as they normally would (perhaps with reference to direction, plot, acting, action, scripting, etc) when asked why they like a film.

Any comments or thoughts (outside of 'the artwork is so good') would be appreciated.","WARNING Princess Mononoke Spoilers ahead!!!

Which films have you watched? I would say my two favorites are Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. With all of their films you have to first accept the fantastical world in which they live. There are ghosts, creatures, and spells. I'll try and give you a run down for what I love about Mononoke aside from the music and artwork (which I agree, are fantastic). I was going to do both but this one ended up long enough.

Princess Mononoke is a real out and out fantasty/action movie. It has very strong environmental themes, anti-war themes, and a number of wonderfully grey characters. Aside from Ashitaka everyone is flawed, proud, and stuck thinking that their way is the only way. No character is all evil or all good. There are strong women and men and each side truly believes in its cause.

The entire opening sequence is excellent. Ashitaka, the prince of a hidden and ancient people, spies something huge and evil coming towards his town. Him and his badass elk Yakul chase the thing down and kill it before it can harm the village but at his own sacrifice. He must leave and try and find a cure to the evil the beast poisoned him with. That evil (stemming from a bullet) is at the base of this movie. All at once it causes great suffering, but it also gives Ashitaka power and strength.

There follows a long excellent journey where he meets various people. It all culminates in the boars' suicide attack and the attempted killing of the forest god, a creature that is perfectly loved and serene. I don't know if you've watched this movie, but every time this scene comes around it affects me. It comes down to a war between nature and industry and as the heroes of nature and torn down in their folly you can feel how it affects many of the characters involved. This got a bit rambly and I have to run, might look it back over later.

As a quick note Spirited Away has a number of big themes as well as being a great film for children and adults (like the Pixar greats) and a stellar and compelling main character. Is it number 10 of all time like the list today on /r/movies put it? I don't know. But I do think they're both excellent.","This type of CMV is pointless. Nobody is going to be able to convince you to be retroactively moved by a film.

However, I can assure you that nobody is ""faking"" their love for these movies, as you suggest. Why the hell would people do that?

"Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for “sleeping around"", and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. 

I want to make this point clear – I am NOT debating whether or not it is good/bad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of ""slut."" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified.

The reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care of/raising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation.

Given these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. 

Once again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction.

To illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue.

Now, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination.

The difference between Bob and Patrick is this – Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over $5 billion from his father's trust fund.

So, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieve/accomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse.

Now, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biology/sociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios. I could be wrong on this, but it's more of an ancillary point rather than my main argument.

To make sure that you've been reading all the way down to the bottom, I would really appreciate it if you started your post with any word that rhymes with ""crime.""

No

&gt;Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for “sleeping around"", and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour.

It seems like the crux of your argument is that it is harder for men to sleep with women than it is for women to sleep with men, and since it is more difficult, it is more impressive and praiseworthy.

There are three main problems with your argument. First, I do not think your characterization of the ""stud/slut inequality"" is fair. When people complain that society treats men and women differently in this regard, it is not because women receive less praise than men. It is because women are met with scorn and hostility. If female sexuality was viewed as merely ""unimpressive"", I think that would be a substantial improvement. Your argument doesn't justify hostility, and so I don't think you have attempted to justify the main aspect of this inequality that people care about.

Second, your hypothesis has no proof. You could equally guess that women should in fact be more promiscuous than men, because they have an incentive to confuse the paternity of their children, ensuring support from as many men as possible. In fact, I think there is much more evidence here in favour of a social explanation. rather than a biological one. It is harder for people to sleep with women because society will criticize women who sleep with multiple people.

Most importantly, there is no obvious reason why a combination of difficulty and alleged biological incentive make something praiseworthy. There is probably some biological incentive to kill others- less competition for food and mates. It is certainly very difficult to kill someone. Is killing someone praiseworthy? Would we be justified in praising them?","Crime. You are correct in that it's harder for men to sleep with a bunch of women than a woman to sleep with a bunch of men.

The problem is you are attempting to shuffle off the ""Morality"" of women being promiscuous to another discussion, but at the same time you are saying that it's justified to call a woman a slut for doing it.

If you are going to say it's justified, we *have* to have that conversation as a part of this one. If the only reason we called women sluts was because it is easy for them to have lots of sex, then maybe we could ignore it, but you and I both know that isn't the reason.

It can't be justified to insult a woman for the same thing you praise a man for, unless you agree that women *should* be insulted for it. It's just not a separate issue. ",147,"Crime.

There are three main problems with your argument. First, I do not think your characterization of the ""stud/slut inequality"" is fair. When people complain that society treats men and women differently in this regard, it is not because women receive less praise than men. It is because women are met with scorn and hostility. If female sexuality was viewed as merely ""unimpressive"", I think that would be a substantial improvement. Your argument doesn't justify hostility, and so I don't think you have attempted to justify the main aspect of this inequality that people care about.

Second, your hypothesis has no proof. You could equally guess that women should in fact be more promiscuous than men, because they have an incentive to confuse the paternity of their children, ensuring support from as many men as possible. In fact, I think there is much more evidence here in favour of a social explanation. rather than a biological one. It is harder for people to sleep with women because society will criticize women who sleep with multiple people.

Most importantly, there is no obvious reason why a combination of difficulty and alleged biological incentive make something praiseworthy. There is probably some biological incentive to kill others- less competition for food and mates. It is certainly very difficult to kill someone. Is killing someone praiseworthy? Would we be justified in praising them?",r2,0.3,0.7,0.8,0.6,0.5,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.3,0.7,0.5,0.4,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.4,r2,,
"Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run?

Money is a medium of exchange it is received when you provide a good or service of value to someone, and spent when you take a good or service of value from someone else.  Therefore the more wealth you accumulate, the more net value you have provided to society.  These people should have more of a say in how our society is run because they have given it the most.

"I have lived in Columbus, Ohio my entire life and have now been legally able to drive for 5 years.  I have driven near and far and have never had to take a toll road.  I recently ventured into Pennsylvania for an internship and was absolutely flabbergasted by the toll roads.  I have always heard from people that they are good because they have higher speed limits.  A lot of the free highways i have been on have 70 mph speed limits and when I went into Pennsylvania, I paid $5.00 to go 40mph on a ""highway"" for a whopping 2 miles.  I also have gone through some other toll roads since my time here but that was the most obnoxious one.  Anyways I just think they are pointless because in no way did it make my travel more convenient.  Maybe I just don't know enough about them but please change my view!

Edit:  After reading through the comments, I really like the explanation I heard that either there will be a toll road in place or that road simply won't exist.

"I would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT community. I have several gay friends and I am very informed about LGBT issues including transgenderism. I believe that conflicts of gender/identity/orientation etc. are innate and not a choice. 

I hold this belief because I feel as though this world will never be fully accepting of the LGBT community. It saddens me to see the statistics of [depression and suicide](http://www.healthline.com/health/depression/gay#1) amongst youth in this group of people. LGBT kids are nearly 4x more likely to be depressed and suicidal than straight peers. The majority are bullied in school as well. Many of these people don't want to come out and have to live with this secret. Many of these people do come out and they are rejected. I understand that the world is a beautiful place because there are so many types of people. I also believe that we should make every effort to accept, love, and tolerate each other. However, we are only making these strides because people have always been and will always be born gay/bi/transgender etc. If this was not possible then this issue would never occur. Also, I am aware that many people in the LGBT community are proud to be gay. However, I can't help but feel as though they are embracing it because they have no other choice. I feel as though most (if not all) of these people must have had at least one dark moment where they felt different and wanted to be like everyone else.

I would like to add that I am not supporting eugenics. I do not want to prohibit people who would be born with the gay gene from being born at all. I just want to remove the possibility of the person acquiring that gene. Furthermore, I do not wish to modify every single gene to make the perfect human beings. I am only speaking about this issue. Also, I would only encourage this if it could be done safely and would have no major side effects.

Edit: My view has been changed and I am done replying. 80% of the counter-arguments were just bashing eugenics and that hardly changed my view at all. Look at the comment by /u/Miguelinileugim for a well-thought, original point.

isn't like the rest of this thread. Most of these can be summed up as ""Eugenics are wrong Hitler are wrong you are Hitler DIEEEEE"". This is not that kind of comment, knowing that please read further.

Eugenics are wrong? Whoever thinks that is extremely close-minded, the only valid argument against eugenics is the risk that it would pose for a group to decide the future of all humans, everything is else is just religious crap or Godwin's law. Eugenics is great, our genes worked great once but now they're incredibly outdated, it's like trying to run Skyrim on windows 95, it's not gonna work well. Eugenics could eliminate anything from genetical diseases and push our lifespan beyond the 120 telomere barrier to eliminating pointless hormonally-triggered violence and improving the intelligence of the population.

Now your problem is the following (other than most likely there isn't a ""gay gene"" but rather some weird interaction of genes that have that effect), homosexuality is inferior to heterosexuality because it limits which people you find attractive to from 45% of the population (ie the 90% of the opposite gender that is straight/bi) to just 5% (ie the 10% of the same gender that is homosexual/bi). Everything else such as weird anatomical stuff and not being able to have children in a conventional way isn't that bad as homosexual sex is about as pleasurable as heterosexual one and artificial insemination and surrogate mothers can solve the problem of having children almost entirely.

Consequently, homosexuality is bad because it limits the number of available partners, but do you know what is almost as bad? *Heterosexuality*. Fuck that crap, bisexuals have it all, they can sleep with men and women alike, they can both enjoy the 90% from the opposite sex and then 10% from their same gender, they can enjoy both genders and experience the sensations that both genders experience, they're just *objectively* superior.

It doesn't matter how much hentai you watch or how many people of the same sex you try to sleep with, the fact is that to some extent sexual orientation is genetical and you can't change it. Having a bisexual genetical profile is a genetical advantage (not necessarily an evolutive one that's why it isn't more common) as it allows people to feel attracted to more people without any downside.

And thus, if we find a gay gene we should eliminate it, and if we find a straight gene we should obliterate it too, and instead put a bisexual gene in its place.

GOD I WISH BEING BISEXUAL WAS A CHOICE BUT I CAN'T, so I'll have to stick with the opposite sex I suppose, darn my luck, but it could be worse.","Logically speaking, if a ""gay gene"" exists, it would eliminate itself from the gene pool... eventually (naturally).

Gays don't reproduce naturally. Now if you are suggesting that gays shouldn't have the option to donate eggs/sperm in order to reproduce then you are perpetuating the culture you yourself are being demeaning off. 

Now let's just say you managed to change the culture associated with the hatred of the lgbt community entirely, and people really couldn't give a rats ass about who you love. In that case socio economics still limits the amount of gays that can afford to reproduce through the artificial insemination procedure. Eventually numbers would lower so much extinction would occur. 

All in all, I don't believe there is a view to change here other than your approach. Since what your asking is taking place by natural selection, all I can say is your reasoning for wanting this to happen is encouraging of the existing culture to dislike the community. Your reasoning seems to accept the bad values that people hold and proposes a solution to live with those bad values. By that reasoning, if we can locate a gene that produces bigots and eliminate that, we could solve all race and discriminatory issues! Unfortunately that would leave us with hardly any humans left.  

My conclusion is that nature in this sense shouldn't be messed with. If it needs taking care of, it will take care of itself. Even cultural systems that perpetuate a bad practice for no apparent value eventually come to an end when they come face to face with a larger opposing view (I.e. Cortes and the Aztecs, or Chritians and the Moors (aka Islamics)). 

Whether you believe in eugenics or not, your reason advocates for it, and if you truly are sincere in not advocating it but still believe in eliminating a certain community, then at that point you really are just discriminatory towards that group and therefore not an ally as you so claim.

There is inconsistency with this post, and I hope that I've at least changed your concern towards the matter to a more cultural one that genetic one.",150,"Logically speaking, if a ""gay gene"" exists, it would eliminate itself from the gene pool... eventually (naturally).

"Improv, as an art form, is a medium almost exclusively to be enjoyed live. SNL, while having improvised elements, does not fall in this category because most skits are rehearsed (regardless of your current feelings on the show, it has worked to some degree of success in the past). 

Which brings me to Whose Line. The show, while being very  clever and featuring undoubtedly skilled performers, just does not translate through television. This is where my argument will get a little murky, because I'm not entirely sure why it doesn't translate. It would seem to follow that something that's funny in person would also be funny through television. I just know that when experienced live, improv has such a bigger effect on its audience than when seen on television. 

The show, as a result suffered, ratings began to falter, and it was subsequently cancelled. In the aftermath, redditors began praising the show for its genius, claiming how it was unjustly cancelled, etc, etc, Colin Mochrie, etc. Reddit simply pretends to like it because of its unpopularity and cancellation, because that then elevates that redditor above the general public. ""Normal people just don't 'get it.' But I do,"" kind of thing. 

I know this is entirely subjective, and you may think I'm completely off base, but I'd really like to get genuine responses of why you enjoy the show, why you believe it is actually funny, and whether or not there is any truth to my assumption of reddit's reasons for liking it.

Change my view.

","I would propose that the reason that the show began to falter was not because of a inability of the art form to be translated through television, but that the show never really progressed in any way and it ran out of material.



Eventually the show just turned into ""Watch Wayne Brady sing stuff! And Colin and Ryan do that sound effects thing!"" which became stale in its repetition.

Differently, SNL has gone through hundreds of actors and even more different skits and even running routines, this has kept it fresh and regularly reasonably popular among its target audience (15-25 year olds probably)

I won't dispute this, though I don't necessarily  see it too often here (but you and I may frequent different places on reddit)

The show was funny for a few reasons:

1. It was completely new when it came out

2. It pushed the edge of what's considered ""safe family entertainment"" - there are a lot of very adult jokes on that show which is surprising considering its air time and audience.

3. It's a rather witty show - sure, there's more than a bit of slapstick comedy (see - Richard Simmons episode) or campy singing, but a lot of the show thrived fast paced, sharp comments delivered off the cuff. This kind of impromptu comedy required a deft touch, and several of the people on the show were quite adept at it.


So overall, it was a good show, but (as we're seeing with it's reboot) there just isn't enough material to keep audiences captivated for a long running show, the show itself became stale, not the idea of improv comedy.","Uh, I've been watching Whose Line since I was 15.

I enjoy it and think it's funny, and think it translates very well, partly because at the time I was a theatre kid and did a lot of improv, and it was fun to watch the people who were good at it.

Where I think Whose Line fails is that it can get repetitive, especially in the later seasons. A lot of topics end up getting rehashed, and if you're a long-time viewer that can be a point against it. And like all improv, some of it isn't great. They're not all winners.

"Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with *most* SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions, but I actually think it does more to silence non-privileged voices than it does to encourage education, empowerment, progress, or harmony.

A college education (or at the very least, the Internet and plenty of time on one's hands) seems to be a standard cost of entry for dialogue with a typical SJW. Dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as: patriarchy, heteronormativity, trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF), cisgendered, gender spectrum, gentrification, respectability politics, privilege, oppression, identity, assimilation, queer, otherkin, institutionalization, marginalization, etc....I could keep going.

These are all terms that I've just pulled directly from SJW Tumblr pages/comments. Some are more easily defined than others, but there are still layers to each concept (such as privilege or oppression) that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time they've been exposed to these ideas.

Honestly, I have a master's, and the first time this language was thrown my way, I felt dumb for not understanding some of it. How might someone who could only afford a high school education feel? I get that they want to use intelligent, specific language to explain some concepts that are difficult to put into words, but how is someone who doesn't have the privilege of a college education, or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts, expected to engage in dialogue that sounds like it's spoken by a women's studies textbook? It can be intimidating, and no one likes to have a conversation that makes them feel stupid. How is this use of privileged language encouraging those who are economically and educationally marginalized to participate?

I don't want to generalize, but from my own experience, a majority of SJWs enjoy doing what they do because they like winning arguments. It's not about empowering and educating. In the face of ignorance, SJWs tend to belittle and insult, rather than educate or allow for a balance dialogue. The attitude is, ""Oh, you're ignorant? Let me make you feel *more* ignorant by insulting you and using words you don't understand.""

Again, I'm in favor of most ideas SJWs tend to champion...transgender rights, #BlackLivesMatter, feminism, etc. I just think they're going about it in a way that turns people off, because they're so concerned with being able to flex their knowledge and with shutting down those who might disagree with their ideas the tiniest bit.

There is no ""SJW movement."" It's just a pejorative label. There is no group that self-identifies as SJWs. There is no ""SJW"" organization. No SJW leaders. No SJW conferences.  

What you view as a movement is just a bunch of independent people with similar conceptions of social justice, and they may have different views on politics, economics, etc.  

&gt;A college education (or at the very least, the Internet and plenty of time on one's hands) seems to be a standard cost of entry for dialogue with a typical SJW. Dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as: patriarchy, heteronormativity, trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF), cisgendered, gender spectrum, gentrification, respectability politics, privilege, oppression, identity, assimilation, queer, otherkin, institutionalization, marginalization, etc....I could keep going.  

So...what, they shouldn't use any terms to describe certain societal phenomenons?  

Cis and trans are not hard concepts to learn, in fact they're being talked about all the time on the news thanks to people like Caitlyn Jenner. Gender spectrum isn't hard to figure out either. Spectrum is a pretty easy word. Combine that with gender, and it means exactly what it says on the tin!  

Gentrification isn't a ""SJW"" term, it's a term coined by sociologists to describe a very specific phenomenon. People who are affected by it know exactly what it is, even if they don't have a specific term to describe it. Giving it a name just makes it easier to communicate.  

Privilege is pretty easy to define. So is oppression. And identity. And assimilation. These four mean the same as their colloquial definition. Queer is something new, but it's strongly associated with gay rights so its not hard to introduce people to that term.  

Otherkin isn't something people are actually pushing for, where are you getting that from? What movement and mainstream figures are pushing for otherkin rights? None, but mentioning this term is how I can tell your view is colored too heavily by what you see and hear about ""SJWs"" on this site (I'm assuming from subreddits like /r/tumblrinaction and /r/adviceanimals).  

Institutional isn't hard either, it means exactly what it sounds like. Marginalized isn't an uncommon term either.  

**Note:** even if you don't agree that these terms accurately describe power dynamics in society, that doesn't mean the terms are bad

&gt;These are all terms that I've just pulled directly from SJW Tumblr pages/comments.  

Tumblr is just a blogging site with *more users* than reddit. A bunch of users on a social media site is not indicative of a social movement, especially if they don't even identify as such. Your view is skewed by what you see on reddit. They're a tiny, tiny, *tiny* fraction of users. They get attention because people like to go out and find stuff that offends them (ironically, just like the SJWs that are criticized!) and post it for cheap karma. Slap an outrageous quote on an image macro and you've got the attention of tens of thousands of users.

&gt;but there are still layers to each concept (such as privilege or oppression) that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time they've been exposed to these ideas  

Problem is, most people's first exposure to the idea is usually through pages dismissive of the concepts. I think that is a much bigger issue than the terms themselves. 

&gt;How might someone who could only afford a high school education feel?  

Tumblr's demographics skew pretty young, just like reddit. There's a lot of high schoolers on the site who do just fine.

&gt;or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts  

These aren't advanced-level sociological concepts. These are basic 101 terms, most of which, as I've described above, match pretty closely with their colloquial definitions. I think you're exaggerating how difficult these terms are.  

I'm not a sociologist nor have I taken any gender studies classes. Nowhere in college have I learned about these terms. If you were able to read about it on a blog, how high do you really think the barrier of entry is? Social media use is absolutely *huge* among youths today.

&gt;How is this use of privileged language encouraging those who are economically and educationally marginalized to participate?  

Because it gives them a name to what they're experiencing. Take for example, gentrification. A poor black family is forced out of their home due to rising rent costs because of yuppies moving in. What exactly is he supposed to call that? Do you have a better term in mind?   

&gt;I don't want to generalize, but from my own experience, a majority of SJWs enjoy doing what they do because they like winning arguments. It's not about empowering and educating. In the face of ignorance, SJWs tend to belittle and insult, rather than educate or allow for a balance dialogue.  

Your view of social activists seems entirely limited to what you've seen on places like reddit. Stop and realize that what you're viewing is intentionally cherry-picked to enrage its audience.  













","Before I get started, I want to point out the problem with using the term ""SJW"" (because this *will* bite you when it comes to the other comments) - it's a pejorative with a definition that's ambiguous at best, and almost no person to whom the term is applied identifies themselves by that term.  If there's going to be a meaningful discussion in further threads, you're going to need to clarify exactly what kind of ideology you're referring to, especially considering the recent trend of infighting within progressive factions (especially feminism) leading to many points of disagreement between individuals in these movements.

In regards to the terminology, the only thing about the ""SJW"" language that makes it difficult is that it's foreign to most people.  Many of these new or newly popularized terms can be defined for easy comprehension in a single sentence, or even less.  What is ""cisgendered""?  People that aren't transgender - done.  What is ""gentrification""?  Rich neighborhoods expanding into poor ones - done.  What is ""privilege""?  The idea that you can be better off by being born into money or being white - done.  Admittedly, many progressive folks make the mistake of using these terms without taking into account their audience, but it's a problem that is very easily remedied.

"I have always hated pineapple pizza. I have tried it regularly for years to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding the appeal but it has never worked. Pineapple is a relatively sweet fruit on it's own and a combination of sweet and salty flavors is not that uncommon, however no amount of pepperoni or any other topping can mask the vile taste and dissappointment that is a mouthful of delicious pizza ruined by the fruit. This has led me to the conclusion that there is either something psychologically or potentially physiologically wrong with people who like pineapple pizza.

"So, I hope this CMV is not to specific for this sub, but I dont see this discussion working in the main LoL subreddits without getting downvoted into oblivion.

The current structure of League of Legends is that there are Leagues in the 5 major regions (EU, NA, KR, CN, Taiwan) and they meet two to three times a year for some international competition. The international competiton usually consists of a third-party tournament, the IEM World Championship, and two Riot organised events, the Mid Season Invitational and the Riot World Championship (the ""real"" worlds). Of these three only the Riot Worlds is the only really big tournament, with 16 teams and a good playoffs and group stage format.
MSI features only the best team of each region and the IEM World Championship uses Bo1 groups into Bo3 in the first playoff bracket, which is often criticised as too random for the title.
The league structure in all major regions is usually divided into a spring and a summer league with a regular season of 18-40 games or so, followed by playoffs to see determine who the best teams in the region are.

In the other major eSport titles (Dota, SC2, CSGO) you have 

* way more tournaments in general

* way more international competition in general

* more important games, as you have more playoff situation

This all leads to my opinion that LoL eSports has the most boring circuit, as the majority of the matches that are being played are low impact matches in the regular season and only in domestic competition.



**Edit:** I would appreciate if you help me understand some of the arguments that you apparently think brushed aside. All I see is that you downvoted me, without really understanding why. I would really appreciate if you be patient with me and make me understand what excactly I am missing that should change my view.


**Edit2** Thanks to everyone who was patient with me and argued even if I didnt seem to get your point. I have some more stuff to think and while my view wasnt really changed I got some stuff to think about. Maybe I will come back in the near future with some of the core issues I see now clearer which are the basis for my view.

Good Night everybody!


**Edit3** Since this is over eSport lets make some shameless plug: There are atm tournaments going on:

http://www.twitch.tv/faceittv This is the faceit final at Dreamhack Valencia with CS:GO, where some of the best team battle for a prizepool of 150,000 $

http://www.twitch.tv/dreamhacksc2 This is the Dreamhack Valencia tournament for SC2 with a prizepool of 25.000 $

And while I dont have a link ready atm, there is also the IEM Shenzen in SC2 going on with some of the greatest players from Korea, also competing for a prizepool of 25.000$.

"For the purpose of this post, I am defining ""capitalism"" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. ""Socialism"" is defined as a system in which the government owns the means of production, and distributes all things necessary for decent quality of life (food, water, shelter, education, health care, etc) for free to all minors and any adult either working, seeking work, or enrolled in school. I understand that this definition is more specific than the true definition of socialism, but I want to preempt any arguments suggesting that people won't look for work if everything is provided for them anyway; they won't be provided for unless they contribute. Also, please note that I am not advocating any specific system of governance; I don't want a debate about the merits of direct democracy. Assume that the system of governance is something effective and relatively democratic, unless there is a compelling reason why my definition of socialism ensures ineffective government.

With that out of the way, here is my justification. I believe that capitalism ensures exploitation of the lower-classes. The winners in a capitalist system are nearly always those who were born into relative wealth already. Even the rags-to-riches stories of our time, such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, they were all born into at least lower-middle class. Those trapped in poverty are normal people, who usually work much harder than the people at the top, and get nothing for it. I don't mean to put down high-ranking executives, or other wealthy individuals, but I think that if capitalism is designed to benefit those who work hard, it's doing a shoddy job. Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair.

And that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.

Not only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a ""Green!"" or ""Eco-Friendly"" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot). 

So, with those reasons put out for why capitalism is bad, here's why I think socialism is better. Socialism prevents needless death and suffering by ensuring that everyone who contributes gets everything they need for a healthy life. Socialism ends cyclical poverty by giving everyone a chance at education, without worries about putting food on the table. Socialism is better for rewarding the hard-workers and punishing the slackers, because without unfair head starts going to rich kids entering the workforce, the real cream will rise to the top (there would be variable wages and such; the government employers could offer raises and promotions to their best workers). Socialism is better for the environment, because the government could have direct control, and would have much more incentive to manage the environment in sustainable ways than short-term-minded corporations.

I guess I can go further in depth in my replies, if needed. I'm looking for a good debate, and maybe a change of heart. Change my view!

EDIT: OK all, so I have been persuaded by a combination of factors that socialism as I define it is not as good as capitalism with generous welfare policies and heavy regulations (think Nordic model). I'll be giving out deltas now. I will continue debating as well, but I think I'm done for now. I will resume later.

I think your facts are wrong here.  Global capitalism feeds billions and prevents waste, whereas socialism has created immense waste, suffering, and deprivation.

To take a specific example, let's look at China.  China had a communist revolution in the 1940s, and has been governed by the Communist party since.  From the beginning of their rule, the party, under Mao, engaged in a program of collectivization and state control of the means of production.  This peaked in the late 1950s with the ""Great Leap Forward.""

It was the largest mass killing in human history.  In three years, [between 20 and 43 million people died](http://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/mao-and-great-leap-forward), largely as the result of starvation.

Since the death of Mao, beginning under Deng Xiaoping, China has adopted capitalist market reforms, including private ownership of capital, property rights, and open trade with other countries.  In that time, [the percent of Chinese residents in extreme poverty has gone from about 84% to about 12%](http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/04/18/heres-how-much-poverty-has-declined-in-china/).  Socialism failed in China and resulted in mass death.  Capitalism has succeeded and pulled hundreds and hundreds of millions of people out of abject poverty.

*edit:* I typoed Deng's name.","*Note: I don't have a lot of information on your whole post, but on the economics side.

&gt;And that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve.

Acually global starvation levels have plummeted since China under Dang Xiapeng went through a capitalistic switch in economic thinking,  more than 500M chinness people have enterned the middle class while the rest are being lifted up.

&gt;Clical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.

Well what you see as faluires other countries see as success example look at China pre Deng Xiaoping and how 60m-70m people starved to death and this is a country that has a larger landmass than the US and has very good farm land, the government organized farmers in antempt to bring people out of poverty the end solution was 60m-70m died due to starvation.


This graph shows the best, in 1978/1979 China Privitized it's farms and they went to a market based system lifting 100s of millions of people out of poverty and into the middle class.(look at this graph: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Prc1952-2005gdp.gif)


Other countries have followed suit to achieve the same success and what is needed to fund this growth in the economy when you aren't as devolped........child labour every country did it from England, USA, to Canada
To say it's only capitalist flaw, that's wrong the Soviet Union had it, Anceint Egypt, North Korea, and many more none capitalistic countries, whenever you have quick growth starting from the bottom everyone works from 5 year olds to 80 year olds.


Capitalism has produced the richest ""People"" in the world record number of people are not starving to death more people are going to schools and are getting treated in hospitals, even some illness that killed millions a 100 hundred years ago has been cured due to capital in the market place.﻿

Theses countries are devolping just like we did 100 years ago and they are going to go through the same things and no one will be able to stop them, look at polls done in China in the 1990s about if their better off know the numbers were in the 90% agreeing they had a better life currently.


&gt;Not only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment.

Well that's not a fair argument since the Soivet Union, North Korea, and other Socialist countries back in the 70s and 80s were known to use the worste envirmental standards in the world.

Also the reason we need oil production still is the fact we need things, even solar power, hydro, wing, and electronic cars still use oil in the production of that item. 



&gt; Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair.

To those people I say what job are they working?

Acually global starvation levels have plummeted since China under Dang Xiapeng went through a capitalistic switch in economic thinking,  more than 500M chinness people have enterned the middle class while the rest are being lifted up.

&gt;Clical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.

Well what you see as faluires other countries see as success example look at China pre Deng Xiaoping and how 60m-70m people starved to death and this is a country that has a larger landmass than the US and has very good farm land, the government organized farmers in antempt to bring people out of poverty the end solution was 60m-70m died due to starvation.


This graph shows the best, in 1978/1979 China Privitized it's farms and they went to a market based system lifting 100s of millions of people out of poverty and into the middle class.(look at this graph: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Prc1952-2005gdp.gif)


Other countries have followed suit to achieve the same success and what is needed to fund this growth in the economy when you aren't as devolped........child labour every country did it from England, USA, to Canada
To say it's only capitalist flaw, that's wrong the Soviet Union had it, Anceint Egypt, North Korea, and many more none capitalistic countries, whenever you have quick growth starting from the bottom everyone works from 5 year olds to 80 year olds.


Capitalism has produced the richest ""People"" in the world record number of people are not starving to death more people are going to schools and are getting treated in hospitals, even some illness that killed millions a 100 hundred years ago has been cured due to capital in the market place.﻿

Theses countries are devolping just like we did 100 years ago and they are going to go through the same things and no one will be able to stop them, look at polls done in China in the 1990s about if their better off know the numbers were in the 90% agreeing they had a better life currently.


&gt;Not only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a ""Green!"" or ""Eco-Friendly"" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot).


Well that's not a fair argument since the Soivet Union, North Korea, and other Socialist countries back in the 70s and 80s were known to use the worste envirmental standards in the world.

Also the reason we need oil production still is the fact we need things, even solar power, hydro, wing, and electronic cars still use oil in the production of that item. 



&gt; Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair.

To those people I say what job are they working? My degree is going to allow me to make a decent living, while a lot of people who have taken weak degree are falling behind, because they think, because they have a degree they should be paid a good salary.","&gt;And that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.

I think your facts are wrong here.  Global capitalism feeds billions and prevents waste, whereas socialism has created immense waste, suffering, and deprivation.

To take a specific example, let's look at China.  China had a communist revolution in the 1940s, and has been governed by the Communist party since.  From the beginning of their rule, the party, under Mao, engaged in a program of collectivization and state control of the means of production.  This peaked in the late 1950s with the ""Great Leap Forward.""

It was the largest mass killing in human history.  In three years, [between 20 and 43 million people died](http://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/mao-and-great-leap-forward), largely as the result of starvation.

Since the death of Mao, beginning under Deng Xiaoping, China has adopted capitalist market reforms, including private ownership of capital, property rights, and open trade with other countries.  In that time, [the percent of Chinese residents in extreme poverty has gone from about 84% to about 12%](http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/04/18/heres-how-much-poverty-has-declined-in-china/).  Socialism failed in China and resulted in mass death.  Capitalism has succeeded and pulled hundreds and hundreds of millions of people out of abject poverty.

" I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer even use firearms (I mean the guns that can kill, I'm not sure since it's not my native language) if he/she doesn't intend to kill? I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing him/her, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen. Plus, even if the suspect is really guilty, a police officer shouldn't kill him/ her, right? And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?

"When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether they are doing it to decrease chances of accidents or they are revenue raising, the power still lies completely in the hand of the person behind the wheel.

Even if the police had the intention of revenue raising, that money still goes toward hiring more officers, putting more police cars on the road and getting better technology to combat road accidents. They aren't making anyone speed, they are just making the best of the fact that people are going to speed, so they might as well bring some revenue in from it.

Edit: I should have clarified that I am referring exclusively to traffic offences eg. Speeding, drink driving etc.

Edit: My view has been changed.

I now see that the motivations behind revenue raising contradict the motivations that the police service is created to have. If revenue raising was the goal, the Police service would not only be out for the wrong reasons, but the entire outcome of what they would achieve would be counterproductive to society as a whole. Due to this, revenue raising cannot be seen as morally sound.","Police often go after out of town drivers because they can make more money off of them (for various reasons). If a cop is ordered to bust out of town plates before in-town plates, it is reasonable to assume that he will pull over a foreigner going 67 before a resident going 70 (in a 60 speed limit) right next to each other. What if the driver going 70 kills someone right after? Would you hold the police force responsible for this? Technically they pulled over a safer driver for an opportunity to make more money. 

Think about how much this kind of behavior could hurt society: In business we call optimizing our resources to make the most money in certain areas *targeting*. This is a kind of discrimination, but because businesses do not have a moral or legal obligation to market their services to the whole population, there is nothing wrong with it. However, police forces are expected to offer their services to the whole population without discrimination, economic included.

"I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to abortion. I haven't really followed the lion thing, that was just an example. People do this in all sorts of conversations. 

I find this reasoning completely flawed. Are we only going to care about the most important issue? Before we care/talk about something do we have to make sure there is no issue more important?  Also, the conversation about X is already happening. The issue is out in the open and people are passionate about solving it. This is great and a bit rare. We should roll with it when people want to make positive change instead of making them feel bad for being passionate about the wrong thing.  People have the capacity to care about more than one issue. Humanity as a whole can work together to solve more than one problem at once. Saying something like this you are trying to derail the argument about X  rather than help either argument.

Absolutes are kind of hard to defend.

There might be times when there is really important stuff going on  and people are spending all their energy and focus on things that isn't really that important. ","The reason people are complaining about the killing of the lion taking up so much airspace is this: there is a finite amount of time in a day, and therefore a finite amount of time that one can spend watching/reading/hearing about/talking about news.

People are made that we're talking about Cecil's killing **at the expense of** talking about the deaths of people like Sandra Bland and Samuel Dubose.

Nobody's arguing that the lion's death isn't tragic.

You say that ""people have the capacity to care about more than one issue."" This is true. However, people also only have a finite capacity to care about issues in general. When certain issues are shoved far enough out of the spotlight in favor of - quite frankly - more important ones, these issues stop being cared about enough to actually effect change.

Tl;dr: it's not that we shouldn't care about ""less important"" issues, it's that we have a finite amount of time and space and mental energy to care about issues in general.

","The reason people are complaining about the killing of the lion taking up so much airspace is this: there is a finite amount of time in a day, and therefore a finite amount of time that one can spend watching/reading/hearing about/talking about news. People are not really mad that we're talking about Cecil's killing in the wake of the deaths of people like Sandra Bland and Samuel Dubose. People are made that we're talking about Cecil's killing **at the expense of** talking about the deaths of people like Sandra Bland and Samuel Dubose.

Nobody's arguing that the lion's death isn't tragic. People are arguing that the lion's death is not so tragic that it's worth completely ignoring yet more examples of not only police brutality but straight-up lies told by the police to cover that brutality up. We want positive change, sure, but it's good to prioritize.

You say that ""people have the capacity to care about more than one issue."" This is true. However, people also only have a finite capacity to care about issues in general. When certain issues are shoved far enough out of the spotlight in favor of - quite frankly - more important ones, these issues stop being cared about enough to actually effect change.

Tl;dr: it's not that we shouldn't care about ""less important"" issues, it's that we have a finite amount of time and space and mental energy to care about issues in general. Therefore, we should apportion appropriately and not give undue attention to an issue which is not as important.",r1,0.3,0.2,0.7,0.5,0.4,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.5,0.8,0.6,0.5,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.6,r2,,
"I've been studying Linguistics as an undergraduate for about 8 months or so now, so this one is important to me academically. In discussions of language, there are typically two camps into which people fall: prescriptivism, and descriptivism. Prescriptivists, think your typical grammarian, David Crystal, Lynne Truss, etc., correcting people's grammar, getting fussy about punctuation, insisting upon proper pronunciation. At the heart of prescriptivism is the idea that there is a way that language *should* be spoken. Descriptivism, on the other hand, argues that there is no such thing as ""correct"" language, that what prescriptivists call ""mistakes"" are just non-standard varieties, and that we shouldn't ever make judgements about people's language.

Linguistics is whole-heartedly and almost exceptionlessly (AFAIK) descriptivist, and as a student, I recognise its importance. The view that there is any single ""correct"" variety of language is obviously misleading from the beginning: which variety? Who says X dialect is better than Y dialect? And judgements against language, I-believe-it-was-Peter Trudgill argued, are actually judgements against people's social class, as supposedly ""incorrect"" language features are often described by the upper classes as being used by the lower classes. And I do mostly agree with it.

But. While I understand all this, I find it difficult to truly shake off the claws of prescriptivism. In particular, the idea that there isn't any ""correct"" language. For example:

""He _went_ to the shops""
""He _gone_ to the shops""

I can accept that in some English dialects, the past participle of ""go"" is ""gone"" instead of ""went"". That's not a mistake. But then take a sentence like:

""Shops went the he to""

This isn't syntactically valid: it doesn't parse as a sentence. You might just be understood, but more likely you would confuse everybody with this sentence, so it fails as communication. If this sentence both isn't a valid sentence, and can't be understood, what other word to describe it than ""incorrect""? It can't be a valid form of language if almost nobody understands it, surely.

So what I'm really seeking, is to understand how sentences like the above can fit into the framework of descriptivism, and for someone to convince me that we can't describe sentences like the above as ""wrong"". Please VCM.

"Hey,

So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about.... this just doesn't make any sense to me. 

It seems to me that if we could view all orbiting matter on a single plane the size of even the earth's crust it would be very clear that space debris is not an immediate issue. The amount of debris relative to the size of the area is not that much... not even taking into account that it isn't happening on a plane but in 3-D space.

Why is this wrong with this? I guess this doesn't take into account gravity (the gravitational pull of a satellite may be substantial at orbit - making collision highly likely). Or perhaps the scale of damage even a bolt could have.. but these to me seem so remote....

Over the next, 20 years we will launch a lot more satellites - but only/maybe then they may become an issue - but at the present time it's like talking about not getting in your car because you are worried about drunk drivers - it may be acceptable but it is not rational

First though, a little primer on orbital mechanics.

Your velocity and your orbit are the same thing.  If you give me the velocity (that is speed+direction) and location of a spacecraft at a single point, I can tell you its orbital path.^1

Second, there are certain orbital ""sweet spots"" which are beneficial for various reasons.  One of the most beneficial (and most crowded) is geostationary orbit.  Geostationary orbit is where your orbit matches Earth's rotation such that the satellite appears to always be at the same place in the sky.  It's great for communication satellites.

Geostationary orbit is a single circular ring around Earth.  It's at the equator, about 36000 km from Earth's surface.  It's not a plane, or a 3-dimensional space, it's a single line.

Ok, so why is this a concern:

First, things in orbit move very, very fast.  When I said that velocity tells me your orbit, I didn't give an idea of how fast these velocities are.  The Space Station for instance is travelling at about 27,600 kph relative to Earth's surface.  That's crazy fast.  If you were listening to the song [about walking 1000 miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ4Ib-7fJqY) on the ISS, you would have traveled a thousand miles by the end.^2

At those speeds, an impact is absolutely devastating.  We're talking multiple times faster than speeding bullets.  

Also, orbits need constant maintenance.  Due to the gravity of the Sun and Moon, anything in orbit is constantly being tugged around and pushed to different orbital paths.  This means that debris which can no longer be controlled will not just stay put, but possibly come intersect with orbits we want to use.

Satellites in active use are tweaking their orbits constantly to keep where they need to be.  When they get to the end of their useful life, they're generally either sent to burn up in Earth's atmosphere, or to a very high orbit to be out of the way.

The nightmare scenario is a single impact between two larger objects causing a lot of uncontrolled debris though.  It would be too small to see where it is, or predict where it will go, but yes, a bolt or a scrap of solar panel can completely wreck a large spacecraft.

"While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously ""earning"" the respect of less experienced and established people completely ludicrous. It should be the other way around, if only for practical reasons (the respect of older people tend to be far more valuable). Now, I'm in no way denying that younger folks have valid and interesting contribution to make. I think a fresh perspective coupled with energy and enthusiasm can be an exceptional driving force. Nor am I denying that older folks can be complete assholes because their certainly can. 

However, I could never bring myself to expect older, more experience and better established people to prove themselves to me. Neither can I see a reason to prove myself to younger people today. I expect respect the same way my father or professors did. Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers. 

Simply put, I find this phrase (""respect is earned, not given"") is most often used pompously by younger people to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason. To my eye, this attitude is the product of four big misconceptions: 

1) **Older people demand respect because of their age and age by itself isn't worthy of respect.** I do agree that age by itself isn't a quality worthy of respect, but I don't think older folks demand respect in virtue of their age alone either. Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.

2) **Showing respect and deference to others cost me something.** Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.

3) **I know these people are whether or not they're deserving of my respect.** Assuming anything worthy of respect about someone is readily available is a common mistake. Relating to the second point, what's the price of respecting someone by default ? Worst case scenario, you change your mind later on. Best case scenario, you've done the right thing. 

4) **You need to prove yourself.** False. Plenty of people ""proved themselves"" already and they shouldn't need to do it again. For instance, people get to positions of power and prestige for a reason. Getting a PhD isn't a walk in the park. Chances are they've been judged by better people than you already. I do understand their reluctance to jump through hoops again to ""earn respect"". 

As such, I think one would be better served by the idea that ""respect can be lost"" rather than ""respect should be earned"". CMV.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","So I've distilled what you wrote down to three points:

1) **Respect costs nothing.**
 
2) **Experience deserves respect.** 

3) **If you've proved yourself, you shouldn't need to prove yourself again.** (This is more what respect buys you than not needing to give respect, but it's related). 

Addressing these points: 

1) **If respect costs you nothing, why don't you respect everyone?** Assuming I'm a more junior, inexperienced person, why doesn't the experienced person respect me equally? Why do people spend so much time and money to earn credentials which are supposed to equate to respect in their fields?

The answer to these points is that respect does cost me something. We don't have the luxury, with our limited time on this planet, to evaluate all corners of a decision. When someone whom I respect tells me something, I rank it higher in my decision making process. That creates an opportunity cost corresponding with any other decisions I might have made. If that more experienced person was wrong, I've suffered in some way. People will take advantage of being respected to further themselves. Look at politicians or religious figures that charge large sums of money for speaking privileges etc. How I use my respect influences my limited resources including how I spend my time; it certainly isn't free.

2) If you accept my first point that respect does cost me something, then we have to assume it's a somewhat fixed resource. **If experience == respect, then I'd have no choice how to spend that respect.** Take two politicians who have been in office the same amount of time. Chances are, you respect one more than the other; why? 

Because one of them was likely right more or made decisions which you agreed with more. That means that not all experience is the same. There is some experience which is of higher quality than other experience. So let's say we work for the same company across teams and you've been around more than I have, you could say you've had more projects than I have, thus experience, but I've been right more. You've kept your business around, but it's limping more often than not. Is your experience as good as mine if I've been right a higher percentage? Should I defer to you? Heck, even if you were right as often as I was - I don't know your motives, the only ones I know are my own. The only experience I can truly count on is a shared personal experience, like working together over the years.

3) **If you only had to prove yourself once, you'd only ever have one assignment in school.** You'd only have one project at work before being promoted. A general would only have to fight one battle in war. You'd only have to go on a single date before being married. 

The reality is that you prove yourself over and over again, everyday. Athletes that were stars yesterday are duds tomorrow. Faithful spouses cheat. Bosses that pushed the boundaries of a business fail to adapt with the times. Respect make make it easier to prove yourself each time a challenge comes along, but you never stop. When you stop, you've already lost that respect. You've already proven you're not worthy.","&gt;Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers.

Yes, that is what young people are objecting to: the idea that simple time on the planet demands deference (by which I assume you mean that the older person's view is considered valid and reasonable unless proved false).

&gt;to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason

Well, let's distinguish groups for a moment.  Because as I see it, you're treating three groups as being the same thing.

(1).  People who have established themselves in the area they're discussing (so a professor of public health talking about Obamacare)

(2).  People who have established themselves in an unrelated area (a professor of physics talking about Obamacare)

(3).  People who are older but do not otherwise have establishing credentials.

Your argument seems to be that group (3) deserves deference because groups (1) and probably (2) deserve it.

&gt;Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.

But that experience would need to be relevant and established.  Otherwise your argument is that simply being alive is experience, and thus that age by itself is worthy of respect.

To wit, a 23-year-old law school student knows more about the dormant commerce clause than a sixty-year-old steel mill foreman.  The latter's life experience is irrelevant to that discussion.

&gt;2) Showing respect and deference to others cost me something. Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.

Except your argument isn't a neutral version of respect where we accept that everyone can have a different opinion and there's really nothing age has to do with that.  Your argument is for *deference*, which would mean the younger person submits on the issue to the older person.  That *does* cost something if the issue is either (a) the younger person believes he has a better way to do things, or (b) the younger person believes he is right and the older person is wrong.

If that weren't true, you wouldn't be posting a CMV, since your logic says that you ""deferring"" to me costs you nothing.

&gt;Plenty of people ""proved themselves"" already and they shouldn't need to do it again. For instance, people get to positions of power and prestige for a reason. Getting a PhD isn't a walk in the park. Chances are they've been judged by better people than you already. I do understand their reluctance to jump through hoops again to ""earn respect"".

And in cases where that's true, the person can say ""oh, and I also have my Ph.D in the subject we're discussing.""  Again, you're treating people with credentials and people without credentials like they're the same group.

&gt;Except the argument's merit can very be based on passed experience. Something older people generally have more of.

1.  Past experience, not passed.

2.  No, the merit of the argument is the merit of the argument.  And an argument based on ""I'm old and in my experience X is true"" is a meritless argument.",165,"So I've distilled what you wrote down to three points:

1) **Respect costs nothing.**
 
2) **Experience deserves respect.** 

3) **If you've proved yourself, you shouldn't need to prove yourself again.** (This is more what respect buys you than not needing to give respect, but it's related). 

Addressing these points: 

1) **If respect costs you nothing, why don't you respect everyone?** Assuming I'm a more junior, inexperienced person, why doesn't the experienced person respect me equally? Why do people spend so much time and money to earn credentials which are supposed to equate to respect in their fields?

The answer to these points is that respect does cost me something. We don't have the luxury, with our limited time on this planet, to evaluate all corners of a decision. When someone whom I respect tells me something, I rank it higher in my decision making process. That creates an opportunity cost corresponding with any other decisions I might have made. If that more experienced person was wrong, I've suffered in some way. People will take advantage of being respected to further themselves. Look at politicians or religious figures that charge large sums of money for speaking privileges etc. How I use my respect influences my limited resources including how I spend my time; it certainly isn't free.

2) If you accept my first point that respect does cost me something, then we have to assume it's a somewhat fixed resource. **If experience == respect, then I'd have no choice how to spend that respect.** Take two politicians who have been in office the same amount of time. Chances are, you respect one more than the other; why? 

Because one of them was likely right more or made decisions which you agreed with more. That means that not all experience is the same. There is some experience which is of higher quality than other experience. So let's say we work for the same company across teams and you've been around more than I have, you could say you've had more projects than I have, thus experience, but I've been right more. You've kept your business around, but it's limping more often than not. Is your experience as good as mine if I've been right a higher percentage? Should I defer to you? Heck, even if you were right as often as I was - I don't know your motives, the only ones I know are my own. The only experience I can truly count on is a shared personal experience, like working together over the years.

3) **If you only had to prove yourself once, you'd only ever have one assignment in school.** You'd only have one project at work before being promoted. A general would only have to fight one battle in war. You'd only have to go on a single date before being married. 

The reality is that you prove yourself over and over again, everyday. Athletes that were stars yesterday are duds tomorrow. Faithful spouses cheat. Bosses that pushed the boundaries of a business fail to adapt with the times. Respect make make it easier to prove yourself each time a challenge comes along, but you never stop. When you stop, you've already lost that respect. You've already proven you're not worthy.","&gt;Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers.

Yes, that is what young people are objecting to: the idea that simple time on the planet demands deference (by which I assume you mean that the older person's view is considered valid and reasonable unless proved false).

&gt;to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason

Well, let's distinguish groups for a moment.  Because as I see it, you're treating three groups as being the same thing.

(1).  People who have established themselves in the area they're discussing (so a professor of public health talking about Obamacare)

(2).  People who have established themselves in an unrelated area (a professor of physics talking about Obamacare)

(3).  People who are older but do not otherwise have establishing credentials.

Your argument seems to be that group (3) deserves deference because groups (1) and probably (2) deserve it.

&gt;Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.

But that experience would need to be relevant and established.  Otherwise your argument is that simply being alive is experience, and thus that age by itself is worthy of respect.

To wit, a 23-year-old law school student knows more about the dormant commerce clause than a sixty-year-old steel mill foreman.  The latter's life experience is irrelevant to that discussion.

&gt;2) Showing respect and deference to others cost me something. Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.

Except your argument isn't a neutral version of respect where we accept that everyone can have a different opinion and there's really nothing age has to do with that.  Your argument is for *deference*, which would mean the younger person submits on the issue to the older person.  That *does* cost something if the issue is either (a) the younger person believes he has a better way to do things, or (b) the younger person believes he is right and the older person is wrong.

If that weren't true, you wouldn't be posting a CMV, since your logic says that you ""deferring"" to me costs you nothing.

"The host country thing has run its course. Organizing the Olympic games is financially ruinous, blatantly wasteful and the procedure favors corrupt regimes willing to put themselves on the map.

Similar to the financial organization of the UN, all International Olympic Committee members should pay according to their ability. The Committee could invest in large stadiums that have an actual purpose after being used for the Olympic Games, namely, the next Olympic Games.

Furthermore, and this is just speculation, this would allow Greece to reap the benefits of the economic surplus generated by the Games.

"First of all, the *law* I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general.

Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. The rules don't tell you to give up your seat for her, but you do.

This short scenario illustrates that rules and morals are two different things. However, I see more and more people defending actions saying it was ""legal"", and therefore it should be alright. 

The death of Cecil the lion is an (extreme) example: the man who shot him defended himself by declaring that what he did was legal. As the global outrage over his actions showed us, it was however completely immoral.

Another example: bankers. I read in a book that bankers that are considered ""professional"" disregard their own morals as much as possible and instead try to do as much as is legally possible. Immoral bankers and brokers are a core part of why the 2008 crisis was able to happen.

I think this illustrates what happens when people use the law as ""moral compass"": immoral behavior. 

Secondly, I think this is caused by the fact that our law is not our morals themselves but rather these morals applied into (simplified) rules.

Thirdly, I think it's impossible to enforce socially appropriate behavior like giving up your bus seat. This follows from my second viewpoint: because rules are simplified results of our morals, they can never cover every aspect of our lives, therefore leaving gaps for bus travellers and dentists and bankers to exploit.

**I think it's up to us to be aware of this and never use the law as a moral compass. Please, change my view.**

"WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that.




Most of the people that I look up to in life and seem to agree with all seem to support abortion. The people I see on the internet are supported for calling out someone who is against abortion, for instance reddit, to support abortion seems to be the widely regarded popular opinion. This probably isn't the best way to put it, but I seem to agree with every other popular political opinion on reddit (I should have thoughts of my own, and shouldn't form my opinions based upon some random website.) I like making fun of racist old assholes, I like making fun if homophobic old assholes, I like making fun of sexist old assholes, and I like making fun of religious old bigots, etc. etc. etc. But abortion seems to be the thing I disagree with, and I kind of feel like an asshole, like I must be missing some key point. I feel terrible that I have the opinion I do, because everyone seems to hate those who have it, and that's why I've come here, I must be missing some sort of point, and I hope that you can point it out for me. At first I just thought I didn't understand the issue well enough, but after I came to understand both sides of the debate, I can't help but wonder why everyone just accepts that a fetus isn't alive, and are kind of ignoring the moral implications of what if it's not? It's not that I think the fetus is necessarily alive, it's more along the lines that I don't think that you can prove that it's not alive (I genuinely don't think we will ever be able to definitively prove it). However I am going to counter my own argument here in saying that you can't prove that rocks aren't sentient either in the philosophical sense, but there is at least reason to believe that a fetus is more alive than a rock. When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality. Now I realize that it's not always consensual sex, and having to carry the child of someone who assaulted you is an absolutely horrendous thing, I would not wish that on my worst enemy, and I don't say that lightly, I really truly wouldn't. I can only imagine feeling as though I would just want to tear the child out no matter what. Never the less, life is life, a fetus is innocent, and the best I can recommend is some extreme therapy taken to whatever (healthy) extent necessary to help a person cope with such a thing. The ""it's going to happen anyway"" mindset I believe is just lazy, there are so many things on this planet that are going to happen anyway, are we just going to let them happen?




Of those who are fine with people having a different opinion, it seems as though the popular opinion among them is that those who are anti abortion should shut up and keep it to themselves, don't bother anyone with it, but to be honest I even disagree with that, I don't get mad at those who picket abortion clinics, I don't see it as a bad thing to do, they literally see abortion as murder, even if you do support abortion, try to get in that mindset, seeing something as murder and being told to shut up and ignore it. (This is also why I don't get mad at animal rights activists, I've seriously considered going vegan, and I kind of think following my own philosophy, it's selfish and hypocritical of me that I'm not.) I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live. We're having two different discussions and getting pissed at each other for not coming to the same conclusion. I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it's not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy. And maybe that's why I don't understand, maybe if it even remotely affected me my opinion would be different. I'm not certain. But please help me change my view, I feel like a total ignorant asshole.






TL;DR: I feel like an asshole for being against abortion

It is sad and unfortunate that we cannot find out if fetuses are persons, that there is no real test. I'd like to know. But it's all in the definition. So my opinion on abortion came from asking ""For a moment, let's say they are persons. Let's even say zygotes are persons!"" From a pro-choice standpoint, this is the worst case scenario, yes? We'll grant the pro-life movement that every fertilized egg is in fact a full person, just like you and me.

Even then, I am pro-choice because I do not think we have a responsibility to other people that goes nearly that far. We do not require people to donate organs, or even blood (which has sooo much less consequence than pregnancy for a much shorter time). Not even to their own children. We do not require people to help others even if they are able. If you want to throw away your food and let someone starve, legally, you can. We may not LIKE this behavior. We may think it is rather awful, even. But we don't want to make it ILLEGAL, because we respect the rights of people to do what they want with their property. We ought to do at least as much for our bodies, which are literally US. 

Basically, I think that the question of personhood is actually not one we need to answer in this debate, because no person can hang out inside you, using your organs, causing you substantial discomfort and the potential of death, for 9 months. We wouldn't make anyone sign up for that to save anyone else, not even their child. So why would we do it in the case of pregnancy?

If your answer is ""they signed up for it cus sex,"" did you sign up for the car accident because you drove? What if you were going over the speed limit? Did you consent to all possible consequences of driving? Maybe, but we still try to save your life when you crash. We do this even for people who are engaging in quite dangerous behavior. Taking a risk (having sex, particularly in the case of having sex with protection) does not mean you signed up for the worst outcome. You know it may happen, but you aren't signing up for it any more than you are signing up for a car accident on your way to work.

We'll ignore the fact, for now, that in the case of rape no consent was ever given at all.

This is why I think abortion should be legal, even if I don't like it very much.","I honestly don't know anyone who is pro abortion. It's a sad and traumatic thing to choose to do, and I'm not sure it's something I would ever choose for myself. 

But not for one second do I think my choice not to have an abortion should affect someone's hard choice to have one.

When is it okay to limit a woman's right to do as she wishes with her own body? 

A women's right to control her reproductive organs should not end the moment someone sticks a penis inside her. 

It shouldn't end when he ejaculates, it shouldn't end just because she happens to be ovulating, or because an egg is inseminated. So when should her rights be limited with respect to her choice to abort the pregnancy? When should the rights of a fetus outweigh her right to choose her own destiny? 

Obviously by the time she gives birth, that fetus has full rights to life. But when did they start? Did the child's rights to life gradually come into being, or were they switched on suddenly?

I think that the fetus should only be deemed to have rights when it could theoretically survive even if the mother tragically died.  Only at this point do I see any point in supporting a fetus' rights. Before this it is too much a part of its mother to survive on its own and therefor too much a part of its mother to have rights separate from hers.

We do not require people to donate organs, or even blood (which has sooo much less consequence than pregnancy for a much shorter time). Not even to their own children. We do not require people to help others even if they are able. If you want to throw away your food and let someone starve, legally, you can. We may not LIKE this behavior. We may think it is rather awful, even. But we don't want to make it ILLEGAL, because we respect the rights of people to do what they want with their property. We ought to do at least as much for our bodies, which are literally US. 

Basically, I think that the question of personhood is actually not one we need to answer in this debate, because no person can hang out inside you, using your organs, causing you substantial discomfort and the potential of death, for 9 months. We wouldn't make anyone sign up for that to save anyone else, not even their child. So why would we do it in the case of pregnancy?

If your answer is ""they signed up for it cus sex,"" did you sign up for the car accident because you drove? What if you were going over the speed limit? Did you consent to all possible consequences of driving? Maybe, but we still try to save your life when you crash. We do this even for people who are engaging in quite dangerous behavior. Taking a risk (having sex, particularly in the case of having sex with protection) does not mean you signed up for the worst outcome. You know it may happen, but you aren't signing up for it any more than you are signing up for a car accident on your way to work.

We'll ignore the fact, for now, that in the case of rape no consent was ever given at all.

This is why I think abortion should be legal, even if I don't like it very much.",r2,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.6,0.0,0.8,0.1,0.9,0.0,0.5,0.6,0.4,0.7,0.0,0.9,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.6,r2,,
"Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and I encourage all men who have been sexually abused to immediately seek help, but I have trouble feeling as bad for men who are raped and it's hard for me to weigh the impact of that rape on their lives. 

The reason is because whenever I think of women getting raped, I think of a strong (and sometimes old) man who clearly has power of a much weaker woman forcing her to do things that she finds derogatory. The fact that women are the prominent gender in the sex slave trade doesn't help. That only makes me feel like a man raping a woman is essentially treating her like property and belittling her humanity. Also, although I can't prove this scientifically, we all know at least that society views men as horny fucks who are out there just to fuck women. This evokes some feeling in me that women are men's ""prey"" and they are the victims who have to put up with this feeling of worthlessness. 

Whenever I think of a man getting raped however, I think of a guy who has had a little too much to drink and is being coerced into sex by a woman who finds him attractive. Yeah, he may not want to have sex with her, and yeah at that point he is way too weak to resist, but because he's a man, there's something inside of me that feels like he can deal with this and it's simply just another night that didn't go so well. Now as for gay men, that's different and I can sympathize with them more, especially if they were the ones who were penetrated. Even though I feel that way with gays, I still don't think of rape of gay men as bad as rape of women.

I guess I may see being penetrated unwillingly as worse than having to penetrate someone against your will. But the fact that toughness and security are associated with males and feebleness and innocence are associated with women also doesn't help. 

I really do hate my stance on this because I like to think of myself as a benevolent person who wants the common good for everyone. Please tell my why I should *think* of male rape as bad as female rape. Again, I really want my view to change.

"I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking ""Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery.""

* Using chopsticks is at best a cultural exercise of contortion.

* Forks and knifes are superior in every way I can imagine &amp; in every situation.

Including :

* rice that is sticky and particularly rice that isn't sticky.

* versatility while eating different kinds of food

* eating with manners

* not having to fear the dreaded fall of food

I hope some of you will be able to help me find arguments to coerce me into using those chopsticks :)


-----------

**Update**

Some facts I've accepted regarding the chopsticks:

&amp;nbsp;

* Exercise fine motor skills

* Give time to taste the food and appreciate it

* Can be used while doing other things

* Are easier to clean, produce and carry

&amp;nbsp;

* Are superior if you want to:
 
 * Preserve the integrity of the food you eat (If you don't want to break a grapevine until it's in your mouth)

 * Eat crusty things (popcorns, cheetos, peanuts...) without dirtying your hands

 * Eat leafs or salad

&amp;nbsp;

* You can have makeshift chopsticks easily while makeshift knifes and forks are still not a thing in 2015.

* Historically better at not stabbing your enemy during dinner?

* Let this be noted, the spoon and the spork were proposed and I'm all in their favors! As for the sporfe, knifoon
and spooned knork I'm more dubious.

&amp;nbsp;

*All of this may be quite situational but in those situations I accept chopsticks as superior*.

"Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a pedantic point. Please don't let it dissuade you from answering. Also, the title should read: ""there is no *consistent* moral framework"". The mere existence of a framework is not a very interesting point to debate.

A few things first: I do eat meat, and I don't want have sex with animals. I believe both eating meat and having sex with animals are wrong. I think that the reason that I eat meat despite believing it is wrong is that it's simply what I've been doing my whole life.

Okay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry.

Consider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: http://www.wikihow.com/Collect-Semen-from-a-Bull-for-a-Breeding-Soundness-Exam

How can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus?

I don't see a justification for either behavior on 'natural' grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally (that is to say, not artificially) there are plenty of things which occur naturally (rape, infanticide, kidnapping) that we all agree are immoral.

After giving out three deltas, I think my view on the question as I posed it has been changed. I think if I could go back in time I would probably have said ""CMV: If it is immoral to have sex with animals, then it is immoral to eat them"" but as far as the existence of consistent moral frameworks justifying one of the behaviours but not the other, I am thoroughly convinced.

I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry.

I don't see the inconsistency. Perhaps sex acts *simply do* require consent, whereas eating non-sapient animals *simply doesn't* require consent. Where is the contradiction?

But here are a few moral frameworks, and arguments from each. Note that it isn't so important whether these frameworks are *true*, only that they are consistent frameworks which justify both beliefs in question.

* Natural Law theories seek to ground norms in their natural *purpose*. The *purpose* for sex might be procreation. Therefore, sex with animals is wrong, since procreation is impossible. (An alternate purpose might be solidifying bonds with one's partner. But, while this purpose may exist between humans, it is dubious it could work between humans and non-human animals. Bestiality is plausibly psychologically harmful.) Carnivorism, on the other hand, doesn't seem impermissible on natural law theory.
* Consequentialism holds that consequences are the primary aspect of moral consideration. Perhaps eating animals leads to greater net happiness. (Maybe not the current methods of factory farming, but what about responsible free range farming, where animals have good lives before being taken for food?) Perhaps bestiality contributes net negative consequences. Under such conditions (which aren't necessarily that implausible), consequentialism would entail that bestiality is wrong, but eating meat is, in some cases, permissible.
* Virtue Ethics entails that a person's character attributes are the primary aspect of moral evaluation. Perhaps a virtuous character would eat meat in many circumstances (like if he knew it wasn't prepared irresponsibly with extravagant suffering, for example) but wouldn't have sex with animals. (Perhaps because they believed it destroyed the dignity of both the human and the non-human animal?)","The benefit gained by eating an animal is much greater than the benefit gained by having sex with one (I would even argue that there are zero benefits to having sex with an animal).  Therefore, eating animals has a higher threshold of harm caused before the net result is a harmful effect rather than a beneficial one.  With having sex with animals, the threshold is extremely low, perhaps even to the point that any harm caused causes the action to become a net harmful action.

&gt;Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry.

In the case of semen collection, there is the benefit at the end of having the sperm needed to create a new generation of cattle (to which the bull is also a recipient of the benefit, even if they do not consciously relize it).  In the case of a zoophile inserting their  penis, there is no equivalent benefit gained by anyone.

You may not subscribe to my moral framework, but to me it is very consistent, logical, and easy to follow.  I make an estimate of the pro's and con's of every action and then come to an estimate of whether each action is a net positive or a net negative (when compared to other possible actions, impossible theoretical scenarios are not included into the calculation as they are not possible).  At the end, I describe whatever action has the most net benefit as the most moral, and whichever has the most net harm as the least moral.  This does mean that many actions that some people see as equivalent in their own moral system are seen as unrelated in mine, as in the case of carnivorism versus zoophilia.

"I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a new one seems like a really dumb move to me. Whatever features you are looking for in a car, you can get better features for the same or a lower price in a used car. Like, say you have $25,000 to spend on a car. You could get a nice new Toyota, or you could get a fully loaded Lexus that's less than a year old and has features that are superior in every measurable way to the new Toyota. Seems like a no-brainer to me which one I'd buy. So basically, aside from people for whom money is truly no object and I suppose people with pathological fears of sitting where others have sat, I just can't imagine any good reason for the average Joe with a limited budget and no debilitating phobias to buy a new car.

I mean, this is like saying that a fire is hungry for wood. Yes, it eats wood but the fire itself is obviously not sentient. Same with life, it requires upkeep but life itself is not a positive or negative thing, it's just a state of being.

"I agree with most of Bernie's domestic politics, but foreign policy is a critical aspect of the presidency and I don't think he has what it takes. To convince me otherwise (and thus support Bernie), you'll need to show me I'm wrong about the following points, or that they don't matter:

1) I've never seen him not looking generally flustered and awkward. Working on international issues requires developing personal relationships, thus being good at making friends. I don't think he is like that.

2) It requires building alliance and persuading people. Bernie is an independent, does not have serious alliances or close friends in Congress despite being there for over two decades. He has not gotten any notable legislation passed. Would he really negotiate the best possible international treaties for the US?

3) A President needs to be able to understand and navigate everyone's goals. Bernie doesn't seem to try to understand everyone's motivations but rather just gets angry at people who think differently from him. e.g. he says things like ""I'll never understand why some poor people vote republican""

4) Being a leader involves standing up to or effectively dealing with bullies and thinking quickly. He has very little track record of doing this. And when the BLM protesters took his mic at his own rally, he just passively let it happen, seemed a bit bewildered. It may have been a reasonable decision to let them speak, but he clearly wasn't in control of the situation. How could he stand up to Putin, Khamenei, etc.?


Edit: Thanks for all of the info, I haven't 100% changed my mind but I was clearly wrong about a number of things as the links you provided show:

He is willing to use force and can be quite serious and calculating in describing his military policy:

http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/video-audio/sanders-on-cnns-state-of-the-union

He does have bipartisan congressional achievements:

http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/inside-the-horror-show-that-is-congress-20050825

He does make friends with people who disagree with him:

http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/bernie-sanders-is-a-loud-stubborn-socialist-republicans-like-him-anyway-20150727

which includes this statement from Chuck Schumer: ""He knew when to hold and knew when to fold and, I think, maximized what we could get for veterans,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, who also participated in the VA talks.

He can be quite assertive in a non-blustery way:

http://youtu.be/WJaW32ZTyKE

And, though it wasn't exactly contradicting my previous view, he does have a better knowledge of foreign policy nuance than I thought:

Edit 2: No, I am not a Bernie shill, I remain an undecided voter and do not endorse Bernie above other (Democratic, anyway) candidates at the moment. This CMV was about a specific concern I had about the candidate. Sorry my post looks ""too organized"", I guess that's a personality thing.

This is pretty subjective. How do you mean flustered? He speaks with his hands (he's from Brooklyn), his hair is messy, but please elaborate on why you feel this way because i disagree that he looks flustered or awkward. Hes actual a pretty good orator IMO.

As a (I) senator, he doesn't have the ""party"" alliances a straightforward Dem or Rep would have because hes the *only* Ind in our federal legislative body. As Dem president, this would change as he'd have the entire Dem aisle. That, in conjunction with hes been in Senate and USHOR for 20+ years so he has friends and has worked on bills with other representatives. That, and as president, his negotiations would take on a whole new level of seriousness when dealing internationally.

How is that any different then other reps? John Beohner swore to block anything and everything that Obama would try and pass. Strictly from a ""I dont like you"" POV. This is bullshit and he needs to be removed for this  (and other things). Were working on that (I live in Ohio).

This wasn't **his** event. It was a rally on Social Security, medicare that he was invited to speak at.

"CMV: ISIS isn't about the US, it isn't about Bush or Obama. ISIS was created because of internal forces within the gigantic Islamic world. It isn't about us, and to think it is is just arrogent and self centered lazy thinking.


I hear lots of people arguing that it is the actions of X or Y president that caused ISIS to exist, but I think the internal ideologies and economic, cultural an political forces within the middle east are much more significant than anything the US did, even the US invasion, or whatever the US did or didn't do afterward may have only slowed or hastened such an explosion in the middle east for a few years.

Unlikely. Films don't take up much hard disc space by modern standardards so for the companies that hold the copyright keeping the things around has an effectively zero cost and well you never known when they might be useful. 

I think part of the problem is that you don't understand the problem areas of modern archiving. Individual TV series and films don't present much of a problem. The problem areas are:

1)Shear volume of data. Backing up the whole of youtube is tricky. The Square Kilometre Array should be able to produce about 10 petabytes of compressed data a day. I don't know about you but I don't keep petabyte hard drives about the place.

2)Non digital stuff. Some is fine. Clay tablets and Vellum can if stored correctly last pretty much forever nitrate film stock not so much. Pirates don't seem to spend much time digitalising nitrate film stock.

3)stuff that requires really specific hardware to function. MANE and MESS do their best but there are limits. Now in fairness those projects are partially piracy driven but it isn't mass piracy. Most people aren't interested in being able to run software for say an HEC2M (although I don't know if any software for that system survived) so the work tends to be done by a handful of rather obsessive people.

1)Shear volume of data. Backing up the whole of youtube is tricky. The Square Kilometre Array should be able to produce about 10 petabytes of compressed data a day. I don't know about you but I don't keep petabyte hard drives about the place.

2)Non digital stuff. Some is fine. Clay tablets and Vellum can if stored correctly last pretty much forever nitrate film stock not so much. Pirates don't seem to spend much time digitalising nitrate film stock.

3)stuff that requires really specific hardware to function. MANE and MESS do their best but there are limits. Now in fairness those projects are partially piracy driven but it isn't mass piracy. Most people aren't interested in being able to run software for say an HEC2M (although I don't know if any software for that system survived) so the work tends to be done by a handful of rather obsessive people.

"I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that information triggers victims, and therefore the information ends up at ends. This includes language such as ""Pepper spray can deter attackers of any kind, and therefore it is strongly recommended that ANYBODY carries it with them at all times."" or ""Hot zones for crime include times after dusk and before dawn, so it is advised to travel in groups at this time to deter attackers.""

People rage at this information saying that I should not ask anything of the victim, and that this information is useless. People often use the argument ""We should teach people NOT TO RAPE""

My issue here is that the suppression of this information in lieu of pursuing an idealistic rape-free culture neglects the current standing of our surroundings, and that dangerous people still exist, and will exist for the foreseeable future. I see no harm in telling anyone that safety is important, and that there are very cogent steps to significantly lower your risk of being attacked and/or raped.

The only instance I would excuse my previous statement would be people telling actual victims of rape what they COULD have done. This does nothing to change what happened, and is a slimey thing to do.

Maybe this is just an Anti-SJW rant that I didn't even know I was making, or maybe I have an actual argument here. If I am not clear on this classic argument, I would appreciate some clarity, and am always open to thoughtful and courteous discussion.

Please no flaming, arguing, or fighting. Thank you!

"**GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE.**

Reasons being:

1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a job or any personal income to speak of. I don't have the financial independence to live by this creed.

2. It sounds like not much fun

One of those reasons is pretty valid and one definitely isn't.

I believe this because it just makes the most logical sense to me. Why on earth would it be fair for me to walk around with a new pair of shoes when there's people I can see *in my own damn neighborhood* who can't afford a square meal, to speak nothing of comfortable clothing? It's just...wrong.

That's why I think that as soon as somebody has their basic needs and some *reasonable, modest* comforts like a TV, and air conditioning, any more money past that should go to a charity, or similarly be used for good.

**I'm really, really not trying to be high and mighty about this**. I don't live like this, and honestly even when I move out and start making my own money I don't think I'd be able to bring myself to throw out the PC and the cellphone and the car. I also don't think there's any non-arbitrary specific point where it could be declared that someone is being selfish with their money, and also everybody's definition of ""basic needs and modest comforts"" is probably different. I think you still get my meaning.

I still believe, speaking in idealistic terms, it's unjustifiable to keep to yourself what would be best spent saving others.

**EDIT:** My V has been C'd! /u/Lesser_Frigate_Bird made a good comment please read it. Keep the responses coming if you want though!

**EDIT2:** A couple of challenges have been along the lines of, ""where do you draw the line on what's a basic need and what's frivolous spending?"" to which I'd have to respond, ""I don't know but I think you catch my drift"". Obviously if we were going to codify this belief into law there would need to be a strict number or strict criteria but on an individual basis, even though it'd be different from person to person, I think everybody knows roughly what's a reasonable need or desire and what's too much.

I *do* think that this is unethical, just based on the principle that pain is a bad thing, but it's not a massive priority for me because I think the amount of human suffering is significantly greater at this time than the amount of animal suffering (due to the greater capacity of a human to experience suffering).

You stated that their deaths are essentially the same, and that you find the suffering of animals unethical.

A dairy cow generally lives about 5 years until it's milk production wanes, while steers raised for meat are only forced to live 18 months or so, and obviously veal calves get to die very quickly.

So while killing baby cows may alleviate more suffering than killing adult cows for food, in practice it is inextricably linked to keeping adult cows alive for food, causing them to suffer far more than they would had they been raised for meat rather than milk.

"After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the idea of posting armed guards at schools is brought up the idea is always shot down as ridiculous. It was never given a reason why people look down upon it. I feel that posting armed guards at schools would directly deincentivize any individual from going to violent crimes at schools. And if the individual wanting to commit is suicidal than the armed guards would directly solve the problem and stop the would-be gunmen before the tragedy even starts. All other ideas on curbing gun violence doesn't seem to have the aspects of deincentification and directness that posting armed guards at schools has. That's not to say that ideas are wrong but adding this idea of armed guards to their respective platforms would, in my opinion, help curb school violence better than any of these opinions could individually.

edit*: I see that most peoples points are that school shootings are rare and the expenses involved would be to great. That's a legitimate and fair argument. I still think it should be brought up for discussion but I see why people look down upon it.

"I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 

1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most of the reason women are given a reputation for taking ages to ready themselves, and given that I think it's unnecessary, it's actually a waste of time no matter how long it takes.

2) It's harmful. Not only physically, where it may causes skin problems, headaches, premature aging, cancer, allergies, other skin diseases, and other things, but it can be harmful to the self-image of the woman wearing makeup, making them dependent upon the makeup, feeling ugly without it, etc.

3) It's disingenuous. I think of it as false advertising. Celebrities are a big indication of this to me, many of them don't look particularly nice without makeup on, and with regular women the drop in attractiveness without makeup is generally even more noticeable.

This is all that comes to mind at the moment.

"From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other.

The first faction is heavily focused on political correctness and the “social justice” movement. They are major proponents of multiculturalism. They tend to view human social behavior as being socially constructed, and the result of the environment, and are often hostile towards evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of outcome than equality of opportunity. Mainstream feminists fall into this category. They are also more likely to support gun control than the second faction. They have more female members compared to the second faction, and are more likely to be religious.
Examples of liberals in this faction include: Hillary Clinton, Laci Green, Mike Rugnetta, Trace Dominguez, PZ Myers, and Jen McCreight.

The second faction is liberal socially and economically, i.e. on abortion, gay marriage, drug liberalization, health care, etc., but is vehemently against the political correctness that the first faction espouses. They are also more averse to multiculturalism than the first faction. They tend to seek biological explanations for human behavior, and are more accepting of evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of opportunity than equality of outcome. Almost all of the members of this faction are atheists. This faction is much more heavily male dominated than the first faction. They are also more likely to support gun rights compared to members of the first faction. They also tend to be more likely to criticize mainstream democrats, such as Barack Obama. Examples of liberals in this faction include: Richard Dawkins, George Carlin, TJ Kirk, Phil Mason, and Carl Benjamin.","It sounds like you're describing young liberals on the internet; I recognize the dichotomy you describe, and I would only object that it oversimplifies, but I'd also say you're missing out on a huge portion of liberals:

* Business liberals, who lean towards classic liberalism but still with leftist tendencies; basically center-left business people. A media example is the Economist.
* Radical leftists, who essentially reject capitalism and are deeply concerned with international issues, viewing most western diplomacy as imperialist or neocolonialist. A media example is Al Jazeera English.
* Unions and Labor. They draw from a long left-leaning tradition, even though their members are often socially conservative.
* The silent majority, who mostly favor liberal policies but would be very confused if you talked to them about how you thought evo psych was a defining schism issue in liberal politics.

Also, I'd point out that evolutionary psychology doesn't make normative prescriptions. For instance, we can accept the evo psych explanation for overconsumption of greasy and sugary foods and still acknowledge that a person's life benefits from a balanced diet.

","It sounds like you're describing young liberals on the internet; I recognize the dichotomy you describe, and I would only object that it oversimplifies, but I'd also say you're missing out on a huge portion of liberals:

* Business liberals, who lean towards classic liberalism but still with leftist tendencies; basically center-left business people. A media example is the Economist.
* Radical leftists, who essentially reject capitalism and are deeply concerned with international issues, viewing most western diplomacy as imperialist or neocolonialist. A media example is Al Jazeera English.
* Unions and Labor. They draw from a long left-leaning tradition, even though their members are often socially conservative.
* The silent majority, who mostly favor liberal policies but would be very confused if you talked to them about how you thought evo psych was a defining schism issue in liberal politics.

Also, I'd point out that evolutionary psychology doesn't make normative prescriptions. For instance, we can accept the evo psych explanation for overconsumption of greasy and sugary foods and still acknowledge that a person's life benefits from a balanced diet.

"I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form.

The facts are:

* McDonalds brewed (and continues to brew) coffee at standard brewing temperatures of 200F 
* McDonalds holds and serves its coffee after brewing between 170-180F (which is no different than most other restaurants)
* McDonalds has *NOT* lowered the temperature of their coffee, nor have the changed the temps at which they hold and serve coffee

To me, the purchaser of coffee acknowledges the fact that they're buying near-boiling water when they decided ""hey, I want coffee"". Change my view, please.

Looks like I screwed up by questioning the frivolousness of the case. Even if the blame doesn't lie on McDonalds, the case does not seem to be frivolous in the slightest. This was an easy one. Thanks guys.","&gt;To me, the purchaser of coffee acknowledges the fact that they're buying near-boiling water when they decided ""hey, I want coffee"". 

Sure. It's unreasonable not to expect a cup of coffee to be very hot.

But McDonalds knew that people were being unreasonable. They had lots of records of previous customers who got burned because they didn't expect the coffee to be so hot.

Prior to Ms. Liebeck there had been 700 claims made against McDonalds for serving coffee to hot.  McDonalds admits that coffee served at that temperature is too hot for consumption as it burns the mouth and throat.

"This CMV was sparked by the reaction to Donald Trump from the right in the recent GOP Candidate Debate but extends to everyone who intentionally used political incorrectness for personal or political gain. 

Donald Trump, who was once considered a joke candidate is now leading most polls for the GOP nomination, mostly due to his unapologetic opinions  about things and his willingness to be open about his policies and ideas. He has also said that “I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct,” and to some extent I agree; political correctness has gone too far in this country and people need to be less offended by things. However, he has used ""political incorrectness""  as an excuse for his awful behavior and comments such as the mexican rapists invading our border and how Rosie O'Donell is a ""fat slob"" and instead of facing criticism for his opinions is being championed as some sort of visionary for people who's opinions don't align with the mainstream instead of the jackass that he is.


Edit: Thanks everyone for all the answers! I'm sorry I couldn't reply to you all but some excellent points were brought up and good debates were had.

"I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do.

Every child growing up seems to desire coffee, but only because it's age restricted, similar to alcohol/tobacco. Now I don't have a PhD in psychology or anything, but there is evidence beyond proof that people want what they can't have. It's just human nature, and I feel like it's what's behind the longterm desire for coffee in that something I was once barred from is now freely enjoyed and encouraged. It doesn't help that many people jack their cups with sugars and creams which at a certain point require speculation as to which substance is actually fueling your perceived energy boost.

I consider myself to be very openminded, especially when it comes to substances put into the body for recreational purposes (I'll leave it at that) but I can't seem to see eye-to-eye to my friends that have been religiously trying to convert me all these years.

The extent of my coffee experience would be instant coffee growing up at home (parents weren't 'connoisseurs' by any iteration of the term but were both pretty addicted to), pretentious (shots fired) coffee shops that my fiends would literally drag me to, and the occasional tinder date Starbucks run in which I would just end up getting the vanilla bean frappe 90% of the time, which is delicious by the way.

It seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.

Could that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee? Has my past experienced not done justice to an entire culture that is coffee? I mean people spend hundreds of dollars a year on it, and for what?
Change my view.

"By ""practical reason,"" I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election.  I admit there can be other reasons to vote--social pressure, solidarity, civic pride, etc.  But on a practical level, I can reasonably expect no difference between the world in which I vote and the world in which I stay home, except that in the former I'd have to go out of my way to perform additional actions.  If I'm trying to decide whether to perform those actions, based on pure self-interest, there is no reason for me to vote.  I'm setting this at the level of national elections (specifically thinking of U.S. elections) because it's true that, given a small enough ""nation,"" your individual vote would carry a significant probability of making a difference.  

This is a classic example of a [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action), and after considering this class of problems thoroughly, I've come to the conclusion that there is no self-interested practical reason to participate in these cases, barring external motivators (such as added incentives).

It would be nice to find a reason to believe this isn't a case, so I look forward to someone convincing me!","Just because it's incredibly unlikely that your vote will make a difference doesn't mean it's never going to happen.

A Wyomingite could guess there's a thousand or so votes separating the candidates at most, and determine that these odds are worth the minimal investment required to make the trip to the voting booths.

And it's not like this is purely theoretical either - there have been a few examples of state elections being decided by only a couple hundreds of votes.

"Let me start off by stating what I believe the reddit basic income theory is. From what I have read from /r/basicIncome, the idea is that in a future utopian society computers will take all of our jobs and there will be a huge number of people out of work. Basic income would be a government-issued wage that would act as a safety net for these newly underemployed/unemployed workers. 

I am not making this post to argue against future automation problems getting rid of jobs. Yes, jobs will require more skills and basic menial tasks may soon be replaced. But that is frictional unemployment, not structural. Its incorrect to say that because a McDonalds cashier got laid off because of a touchscreen order screen that said McDonald's worker will never work again. 

Many people on reddit would like to implement Basic Income today. They state that it would rid our problems with a complicated tax code, food stamps and other welfare programs. The huge issue is when you have a dead wage safety net you create a massive systematic disincentive to people to work. If people make a certain wage while working zero hours a week, why go get a job at the grocery store? The marginal value of a full time job becomes diluted. 

Next off, wages are considered elastic. Wages are often sticky, but they will still react to the market, especially new hires. If everyone is getting basic income, employers would simply cut costs and pay people less in wages because why not? Employees would be indifferent because they aren't netting less money, since basic income would make up the difference. Competitive wages would suffer.

Basic income would be a government-issued wage that would act as a safety net for these newly underemployed/unemployed workers. 

That's only a fraction of it. Basic income would serve as the basic means to redistribute resources, based on the idea that automation and organization which allows much of our current productivity is a common resource, not a private one. This would indeed serve to mitigate the consequences of automation and concentration of capital in the hands of ever fewer owners, but first and foremost it's a different way to organize resource distribution, since labor is no longer in chronic shortage, so it makes no sense to force people to provide it by threats of misery and starvation.

&gt;But that is frictional unemployment, not structural.

That's just your opinion.

&gt;The huge issue is when you have a dead wage safety net you create a massive systematic disincentive to people to work.

The current system punishes people who start working and stop being eligible for welfare, by taking away that welfare. A basic income would remain stable, and those people would get the full incentive to work instead of a punishment.

&gt;If people make a certain wage while working zero hours a week, why go get a job at the grocery store? The marginal value of a full time job becomes diluted. 

If unemployment is in the double digits, why expect everyone to work full time at all? The economy doesn't need that much labor anymore.

From another angle, why do people now often have several jobs accumulated? We can observe that income from one job does not stop them from getting another, *even* if it requires working from dusk till dawn. So I don't see why think people are going to be couch potatoes all day.

&gt;Next off, wages are considered elastic. Wages are often sticky, but they will still react to the market, especially new hires. If everyone is getting basic income, employers would simply cut costs and pay people less in wages because why not? Employees would be indifferent because they aren't netting less money, since basic income would make up the difference. Competitive wages would suffer. 

*Then* they would effectively reduce the added value of work for their employees, who would quit - because now they *do* have an alternative. So that would force employers to bid the price of labor back up again.","In an economy where there are only jobs for the 10% because of technological automation, and where those jobs require very educated people because they're in fields like science or advanced engineering that can't easily be automated, you can:

&gt;From what I have read from /r/basicIncome, the idea is that in a future utopian society computers will take all of our jobs and there will be a huge number of people out of work. Basic income would be a government-issued wage that would act as a safety net for these newly underemployed/unemployed workers. 

That's only a fraction of it. Basic income would serve as the basic means to redistribute resources, based on the idea that automation and organization which allows much of our current productivity is a common resource, not a private one. This would indeed serve to mitigate the consequences of automation and concentration of capital in the hands of ever fewer owners, but first and foremost it's a different way to organize resource distribution, since labor is no longer in chronic shortage, so it makes no sense to force people to provide it by threats of misery and starvation.

&gt;But that is frictional unemployment, not structural.

That's just your opinion.

&gt;The huge issue is when you have a dead wage safety net you create a massive systematic disincentive to people to work.

The current system punishes people who start working and stop being eligible for welfare, by taking away that welfare. A basic income would remain stable, and those people would get the full incentive to work instead of a punishment.

&gt;If people make a certain wage while working zero hours a week, why go get a job at the grocery store? The marginal value of a full time job becomes diluted. 

If unemployment is in the double digits, why expect everyone to work full time at all? The economy doesn't need that much labor anymore.

From another angle, why do people now often have several jobs accumulated? We can observe that income from one job does not stop them from getting another, *even* if it requires working from dusk till dawn. So I don't see why think people are going to be couch potatoes all day.

&gt;Next off, wages are considered elastic. Wages are often sticky, but they will still react to the market, especially new hires. If everyone is getting basic income, employers would simply cut costs and pay people less in wages because why not? Employees would be indifferent because they aren't netting less money, since basic income would make up the difference. Competitive wages would suffer. 

*Then* they would effectively reduce the added value of work for their employees, who would quit - because now they *do* have an alternative. So that would force employers to bid the price of labor back up again.",r2,0.3,0.2,0.7,0.5,0.6,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.2,0.6,0.6,0.5,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.1,r1,,
"I mean all jobs, such as police officers, military personnel, CIA operatives, security clearance applications, teachers, lawyers, and doctors. Some of these professions will outright ask on the application if the person has a mental illness. Some people will say that certain professions are so important, that a person with a mental illness should be denied. But people who advocate discrimination against the mentally ill are simply misinformed about the fact that mentally ill people have the same rights as everyone else. While the media portrays mentally ill people as violent, this is simply not true. Mentally ill people are no more violent than the average person.

"Before I continue, I would like to start by saying that I am not a pedophile and that I am strongly against the sexual abuse of children. 

My view is based on scientific evidence which strongly suggests that allowing pedophiles to view child porn will result in fewer instances of sexual abuse.

Now I understand and accept that some people will say that children who feature in child porn are re-victimised when they learn that people are viewing images of their abuse, but by legalising viewing, this would mean that the victims will never learn that images of their abuse are being viewed and so they will not suffer re-victimisation. 

There is no evidence to suggest that pedophiles who view child porn are more likely than not to go onto abuse children. In fact, the research suggests the exact opposite. It suggests that pedophiles who have access to child porn are more likely than not to stick with child porn to relieve their desires rather than abuse a child. 

My view is based on a study titled [""Legalizing child pornography is linked to lower rates of child sex abuse""](https://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/springer+select?SGWID=0-11001-6-1042321-0).

Child abuse is abhorrant, but I think to ignore this research is irresponsible. 

I will not be convinced by anecdotal evidence on this by the way. Please make sure you provide reliable sources for your opinions, like I have. 

CMV.

Edit: Someone has suggested that I make it clear that I am only talking about the viewing of child porn to be legal and not the production or distribution of images.

"There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is that the vote should be your own, informed choice, rather than letting someone else make the decision for you.


Point 1 - http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-verification-without-id-documents.aspx
The ncsl site details some terribly inefficient and time consuming ways to verify someone's identity without an ID. Time needs to be used to look up data and then more time needs to be spent comparing data. And then more time after that when things dont match up and you have to fix / argue your want through.

Point 2 - I have trouble understanding the argument about how requiring IDs to vote is discriminatory in a bad way. The argument is that requiring an ID would discourage poor people from voting. Even the poorest citizens engage smoking and drinking, which are activities that they probably have been asked for an ID for. I find it inconceivable that someone without an ID would be someone capable of making an informed vote. If you couldn't find the time out of all the years in your life and maybe 10 dollars to get an ID, then I believe that you are the exact type of irresponsible person who should not be voting at all.

Point 3 - There are long lines at voting and requiring IDs would cut it down. The government requires employers to pay workers while they take off to go vote. I can think of many employers who will tell you to take the whole day off rather than pay you a full day for half a day's work. This is a partially broken law which only works for full time employees. Part time employees, which generally make less money, often cannot take advantage of this. I'd make the argument that by not requiring ID's to vote, they are discriminating against people whose time is more valuable than voting. I believe the best way to encourage voting is to make voting easier and less time consuming. 

Point 4 - Perhaps instead of trying to tackle enormously expensive projects like free healthcare and free college, we can start with the easy and low cost / high benefit ones like free ID cards.","It's worth noting that many elderly African Americans were born outside of hospitals due to Segregation, and were never given birth certificates.  Many African Americans also have names misspelled or birthdays wrongly listed on birth certificates.  The ""separate"" black hospitals back in the 50's and 60's weren't quite ""equal"" to the white hospitals at this paperwork.  It seems particularly cruel that a group that's only been able to vote for 50 years will now have to jump through hoops, bureaucracy, and complicated paperwork to exercise this right. 

I disagree that free ID cards is a low cost/high benefit solution.  Hundreds of millions of dollars spent to combat a non-existent voter fraud problem seems like a high cost for no benefit.  Furthermore, it doesn't solve the early voting/absentee voting fraud potential, which probably is a much easier and safer way to commit voter fraud.  

Finally, lines at voting stations could be fixed by hiring more employees or opening more stations.  These long lines are often blamed on partisan decisions to intentionally suppress low income and minority votes, and this problem wouldn't necessarily go away with more IDs.  ","This only exists to screen out voters. You yourself admit in points 2 and 3 that you're not only trying to reduce the total number of voters, but prevent the wrong kind of person from voting. This is a blatantly undemocratic point of view. Citizens should not have their basic rights revoked just for not carrying a small piece of plastic with them. It seems obvious, but it needed to be said. 

There are zero upsides to requiring ID. You know why illegal immigrants won't vote in the 2016 elections? Because they're not registered with the government as eligible voters. We already have a system to prevent voter fraud, and putting up bouncers at polls is just redundant. 

And on top of being redundant, ID law wouldn't solve the ways that voter fraud currently is perpetrated. Voting machine tampering, vote buying, and fraudulent absentee ballots are a problem in our system, and would never be addressed by voter ID. The only thing that would is ""voter impersonation"".

I don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. 

Suppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a ""creep"" for ""looking through"" her profile. 

I'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have ""good old days"".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as ""creeping someone's profile"" online. Putting aside when a ""profile"" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. 

So the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...

I feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them.

There is definitely a colloquial use of ""creeping"" that doesn't imply anything negative. Also, it's frequently thrown around in a sarcastic manner, or simply as a joke. 

This really has to be broken down into a case-by-case basis, and even then, you might just be misunderstanding somebody.

I will say that I think ""creeping"" is thrown around more casually these days in that specific context because of the ubiquity of social networks. *Everybody* has a Facebook page, and most people have so many Facebook friends that 80% of the content their friends post never even makes it to their timeline.

So with that in mind, depending on what specifically you mention as having seen on somebody's Facebook, that almost automatically implies that you put in an effort above and beyond simply becoming Facebook friends and passively monitoring your own personal timeline. It may be a trivial amount of effort, but if somebody becomes aware of the fact that you actively searched through their profile in particular, it is unsettling to some degree... again, this is highly contextual. Nobody wants to suddenly realize that the person they just became Facebook friends with yesterday poured through 5 years of their history and actually paid enough attention to bring up something that happened years ago. The actual act of quickly scanning a new friend's profile isn't really weird, but you have to admit, in a real life social situation, it's a bit awkward to bring something up from it that you weren't personally involved in that happened a long time ago. It just makes you seem like you're coming on really strong.

Also, I think in most people's minds, there is still a disconnect between social networks and reality. Sometimes it's just a bit unsettling to realize that everything you put on social media reaches a MUCH larger audience than you might have *really* intended for it to, harmless or not.

So there are a number of reasons for some people reacting negatively to bringing up something from a social network. I'm not sure that really changes your view at all, but it's an interesting discussion.","One problem is that neither Facebook nor humans have ultra fine ways of filtering their content. You might have a couple groups that you limit access to, but even that's quite a bit of effort and not very effective. 

Say you just become friends with someone. You likely weren't part of their lives in any meaningful way five years ago. You don't know that much about their personal history. They aren't the same person they were then either - they look different, hold different opinions and have a different assortment of friends. 

There's nothing at all strange or off putting for my old friends from elementary school to visit my mom and look through her old photo albums. If someone I recently met did that, that would be incredibly disturbing. What are they really trying to get at? Do they think that this old content is going to give them insight into me and my life, and if so, that's a pretty high level of effort and personal engagement. 

Facebook has also changed *a lot*. These days it's very much about transient social interactions. Personal information is off the main page and pictures usually just get thrown up rather than put in organized folders. I'd argue that interactions, images and often even personal information on Facebook aren't nearly as good of a way to get a sense of someone as they once were. 

When you comment on an old item, you are usually doing it out of context.  Commenting publicly is also a performative public act, not a personal communication. 

Still, this also doesn't mean that there aren't people that need to chill. Some people literally consider it to be 'creeping' if you mention the things they've posted publicly to them in person. It's almost like they're so detached from their social media life that they don't fully identify with the person that generated and shared that content. That's stupid. 

Some people call any interaction with their public content by someone they don't like 'creeping'. No, you should unfriend or restrict them if you don't want them seeing your content or ask them to stop if you don't like their comments.

But the above arguments don't address those cases - they look at the cases where digging up old content be a real signal that someone's both extremely, perhaps worrisomely enthralled with your life and feels the need to respond to it performatively.

Nobody wants to suddenly realize that the person they just became Facebook friends with yesterday poured through 5 years of their history and actually paid enough attention to bring up something that happened years ago. The actual act of quickly scanning a new friend's profile isn't really weird, but you have to admit, in a real life social situation, it's a bit awkward to bring something up from it that you weren't personally involved in that happened a long time ago. It just makes you seem like you're coming on really strong.

Also, I think in most people's minds, there is still a disconnect between social networks and reality. Sometimes it's just a bit unsettling to realize that everything you put on social media reaches a MUCH larger audience than you might have *really* intended for it to, harmless or not.

So there are a number of reasons for some people reacting negatively to bringing up something from a social network. I'm not sure that really changes your view at all, but it's an interesting discussion.",r2,0.8,0.3,0.7,0.6,0.5,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.7,0.5,0.6,0.6,0.5,0.6,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.8,0.4,0.5,r1,,
"Admittedly Strip Clubs have come to be seen as a fun and even ideal environment for partying. The 'by-the-book' clubs don't allow clients to have sex with the strippers, though of course it most likely happens a lot and many strippers are prostitutes, but not all. The two jobs aren't all that dissimilar (sex work), though stripping is more of an art and I imagine the best performers take it quite seriously and don't sell themselves (cheaply).

On the client side, I think the only reason strip clubs came to be is due to a crackdown on 'out in the open' brothels and the type of men who would go to a strip club would also go to a brothel if they didn't feel like criminals. If brothels were legalized I can see some of those businesses eventually reaching a similar level of social acceptance, thus brothels will become more than a series of dark rooms full of sex-slaves and may become the amusing harems and menageries of historical fiction. 

I find that not only will clients prefer the legal brothel with a nice entertainment budget. Why just go watch a girl dance around naked? Why not touch her as you like and even have sex? Or watch people have sex etc. The type of men who regularly go to strip clubs most likely only go because they cant get attractive women to pay attention to them and are willing to deal with teasing and stripping because an illegal brothel can result in infections or jail time. 

I even suspect that the performers will end up working in brothels rather than strip clubs. Seeing as there are women who will have sex with them without legal repercussions men won't throw as much money at a girl who is just taking her clothes off. No doubt brothels will end up having some of the girls strip to entice clients to go into the back rooms with them. The artistic side of stripping, which only exists due to the illegality of brothels and male willingness to throw money at attractive women, will lose a great deal of funding and talent.

"So first of I am danish. That means that I follow american politics, much in the same way I follow german politics. Somethings are importent for me and my situation, but most thing are not that importent to me. It is kind of like watching a football match where you don't cheer for any of the teams.

With that said I find it kind of scary that there is a Clinton and a Bush in this election. The kings in Denmark used to be elected, some thousand years ago, but then it became normal to elect kings from the same familly. Then latter it was always the oldest son and then we endeed up with the system where the king was always the oldest son from the old king. The same is more or less true in many other countries. People seem to rather want to vote on people from families they know than random people.

To me it kind of seems like America is getting set in their political dynasties and that if this development continues, we might end up with a system where everyone in theory can try to be elected president, but in practise it will always be people from the same political dynasties that gets elected. That is not a nice view to have. Please change it.

Chelsea Clinton hasn't followed her parents into politics, aside from stumping for her mother, so it's unlikely there's a political dynasty in the making.

The Bush thing is more an anomally than a trend. George Sr. was a successful politician, was elected Vice President on the Reagan ticket from 80 to 88. (it's important to note that VP of the US has litte official power, just to cast the tie-breaking vote in the senate, and to replace the president if he dies), he was elected president from 88 to 92.

His campaigns were orchestrated by political genius/satan incarnate Karl Rove, who knew exactly how to brand him, and ran effective smear campaigns in governor, primary and presidential races.

"If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is more valuable than learning any European language.


-Travel

It's easier for Europeans to learn English and harder for East Asians to learn English.
Most Europeans at the very least speak basic English, and most East Asians only know English words.
You can travel across Europe only knowing English, but in East Asia it helps more to know the language.
I don’t consider places like South America and China to be developed enough to travel through, other than tourist spots catering to English speakers.


-Media

When it comes to media, East Asian countries have their own isolated worlds. Going through their music, films, television and books can almost feel like visiting an alien world since so little reaches the west. 
Specifically Japan and South Korea are economic powerhouses and understand the importance of [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power), and as a means produce a lot more films, music, games, comics, literature and TV than any European or South American country.


-Availability

European languages have more speakers than East Asian languages, but most Europeans already speak English.

For an American there may be a lot Latin American immigrants, but there are Asian immigrants everywhere in the world.

East Asian languages might not be as widely available, but their populations are educated, travel a lot, and have [more native speakers than other European languages.](http://i.imgur.com/SDrGTr8.jpg)


-Difficulty

East Asian languages are said to be notoriously hard by Europeans, but with technology in just the recent years it has become a lot easier. Chinese characters, hangul and Japanese writing systems can now be learned on your smartphone by playing games with apps like memrise or anki.

A lot of European-language speakers complain about how complex European grammar tends to be, whereas East Asian grammar often is “logical” and straight to the point (with exceptions, as any language). 
If you disclude writing systems, East Asian languages would be easier to learn as a spoken language than European ones for someone who has experience with neither.


-Cultural benefits

It’s almost as if their worlds are isolated from ours.
Learning a widely different language helps us understand the structures of our own languages. Learning about a completely different culture helps us understand the uniqueness of our own culture. 

European cultures are often so similar that we only tend to think of simple things as being differentiating between countries, but what makes us unique as westerners becomes much more apparent when compared to a country at the other side of the world.

Germany is our biggest trading partner, there is value in learning German for economic reasons.

"This is a very sensitive topic so sorry for posting it here if I am not supposed to. This is a true CMV, I am on the fence about the issue ever since I joined reddit which is pretty liberal. I have always belived that the government is using any information they get fairly, catch criminals, stop possible terrorism stuff like that. The only time I think it has actually worked (to my knowledge) is when they caught a child pornography dealer through Gmail. I think its in the law abiding citizens best interest to be spied on. Please Chang my opinion if you feel thats wrong. Once again, I am on the fence on this so the most I will do is play Devils Advocate. To much I see in this subreddit people who obviously dont want their opinions changed. 

Edit: I dont know if I filled the 3 hour requirement but I came pretty close. Its 12 PM/AM (Midnight) here on the east coast and I have my last exam of the year (Biology, riding the line on a Low A or High B, wish me luck) and I need to sleep...or study...one of the two. Keep the replys coming, its been very interesting. As for the future replys I notice some of the ones we have now have nothing to do with the topic, try to keep it focused on the act of spying not corruption in the government. They can be viewed as the same thing but try to keep it about the topic. Thanks and Good Night

"Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 1000 songs in our library. Not to mention, iTunes is the only thing that will properly communicate with my Apple product that I use for music.

I realize you can download pretty much as much music as you want, but to get that, you have to pay. Whereas iTunes is free. I'm not really the type of person who's into discovering brand new music all the time. Occasionally, I'll expand my horizons until I find an artist who really sticks, and then I'll play the crap out of their music until I'm pretty much sick of it. Back in the day, when I had a Zune to play music, they had a similar feature where you could pay a fixed subscription fee to download as much music as you wanted for free. Even back then, an offer like this didn't pique my interest.

Knowing this, are there any standout features that evolve the listening experience so much that I'd be willing to abandon my iTunes library and start over again?

Edit: I've decided that I want to experiment with Spotify and at least try it out. Thank you to all the people who replied. You all gave really helpful information. Also, a side note, this is one of my very first posts and, by miles, my most commented on one. So thank you for the good conversation as well. ","It entirely depends on your situation. If you have no music library building up 1000 songs (legitimately) will cost you roughly 1000 dollars. This is 8 1/3 years of Spotify premium which would give them access to those 1000 songs plus all other songs that have been and will be released during that period.

IF you are someone with 1000 songs already but find yourself spending $120 a year on music then you'd be strictly better off buying spotify as this would allow you to acquire those new songs you want while also giving you access to all the other songs available.

The only real question is if you spend less than $120 on music per year. In which case you should consider how much music is worth to you. If you spend 0 dollars on music and are totally content with the music you have then don't get the service. If you spend $60 a year already then maybe 5 bucks a month to have complete  freedom with your music is worth the cost.

"I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically many more people are killed by other forms of energy generation (I believe!). That's not to say that this isn't a worry, on some level. It's just not my top worry.

I am, however, concerned about nuclear waste. The goal of developing alternative energies, to my mind, is to reduce our environmental footprint and save our ecosystem as we know it. Sure, we might slow global warming using nuclear energy - but to my knowledge, we don't really have any good way of dealing with nuclear waste. Investing in nuclear energy is just a way of trading one environmental problem for another.

Second, other forms of renewable energy are increasingly cost-effective and efficient. There's no reason to be generating nuclear power when we can do just as well with other forms of energy.

Third, nuclear energy is an international conundrum. If we could move away from nuclear energy in the United States and invest globally in other forms of renewable resources, we would be able to prove, in some small way, that nuclear energy programs are unnecessary - and, therefore, give us more leverage to refuse to tolerate them in diplomatic talks.

"This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in.  I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained.  

My wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country.  I will reflect on my mother’s story.  She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country.  When she came to this country she was on government assistance.  With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master’s Degree.  Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community.  I don’t need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent’s generation, their hard work and sacrifice.  

I hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country.  I’ve read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings.  However I don’t completely buy into it.  I’ve seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education.  As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I’ll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do.   At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint.  As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings.  They had no problems acting 'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america.  That is why I don’t have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty.  I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story.  If there are books or articles which provides a cogent counter argument please feel free to share.    

TL:DR – The rationale for why blacks and Hispanics are unsuccessful in the U.S. are bunk because of the success of Asian Immigrants.  

Edit: This is not to say that there isn't racism in society, especially towards Asians.  Colleges definitely try to make it harder for Asians to get admitted despite higher scores, and there is a Bamboo Ceiling in the workplace.  However, I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.  

Edit2: I appreciate the dialogue.  One point which I'll concede and am swayed from the dialogue is that racism, more specifically the historic racism perpetrated in the U.S. such as Jim Crow and Slavery created the culture which is present in the poor black community, hindering them from rising from poverty.  But nothing disputes that this culture is reason, and not the present-day racism that is preventing them from achieving in this country.  That is what I have issue against that the media portrays a image of victimization due to current day racism, however, I don't think the type of racism is the cause, maybe past racism, but not the type minorities face today.  If no one has a counter argument against the cultural aspect, shouldn't black culture, the one that glamorizes the baller lifestyle, be the focused of policy makers to change rather than focusing their efforts on social restructuring to accomodate the culture?  

Edit3: At the end of the day, and the dialogue set forth I come away from it with the following:

1) That current poor black culture  is a result of systemic discrimination.  
2) No one has disputed that culture which I have generally claimed is the REASON for the state of poor black americans.  
3) The present day racism and white privilege that exists today is not sufficient enough to either hold a demographic down or lift them up, not as much as the modern day media seem to claim.   
4) I want to beef up on some books and articles cited
5) The IQ debate. hmmm I'm just not going to touch that right now.  
","A better explanation is that asians do better because they have higher IQ.

this is also consistent with findings that jews have higher iq, and that jews do well in the US.

It is consistent with findings that blacks and hispanics have low iq, and that they perform worse in the US.

This is also consistent if you compare majority black countries, which are always underdeveloped, to white and or asian countries, which have a mix of level of development. Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singpore and Japan are prosperous nations inhabited by majority asians, who have high iq. 

Blacks also perform poorly in all countries, not only in the US.

It really hasn't been that long since that period and the racism from that still persist for a period of time after changes in laws.

For the Latino population, many are illegal immigrants, which really affects their earning potential. Then their families also tend to be bigger too which means more money needed to support. Teen pregnancy rates were also higher for them which hinders them too.

"My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother insists he doesn't act up at home, but the teacher has called her multiple times about her son's behavior. She can't take away recess from kids. She can only send them to the office for 20 minutes at a time. She's not allowed to take pictures or videos of the kids (but she showed us pictures/videos of the kid that day breaking into drawers, throwing stuff, yelling, rolling up carpets, etc). Attempts to discuss the kid with admins are shrugged off. The teacher is very upset because the other kids have complained that they can't learn and some are beginning to follow suit of the shitty kid. 

I know this is one example, but her school isn't even among the worst, and it isn't as if teachers inability to control students, despite their wishes to, is surprising. We've all heard about terrible parents, helicopters, complaining about grades etc.

I've had the fortune of going to private schools my entire life (though perhaps that is more due to growing up in one of the worst public school districts in the country). One of the effects of that is that they could discipline you as they saw fit. If you acted shitty, you missed recess, had to call your parents, had to write on the chalkboard, had to stay in the office, got yelled at, etc. Public schools, of course, are another matter and it seems like teachers, the very people entrusted with educating the future, are powerless to do their jobs properly. 

So tell me, is our educational system that fucked because of shitty parents, shitty kids, and shitty administrators, or is it really not that bad? CMV.

"Little disclaimer: this deals with US laws and procedures so I apologize if anyone outside the US isn't able to contribute, except to tell me how great it is having this in their own country.

Last Sunday John Oliver's show dealt with this subject and chastised the US for being only one of two developed countries in the world without maternity leave that is paid for by the taxpayers. Here is a link to watch it if you haven't seen it yet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIhKAQX5izw

Here is the gist of my viewpoint:
In the US, when a person is terminated from a job, he/she is entitled to unemployment benefits for up to 99 weeks or until they are employed again. Workers and companies pay into this and, while many people end up taking more than they give, it is the system we have and it seems to work for the majority of people here. When a person leaves a job VOLUNTARILY, however, they are not entitled to unemployment benefits. If you quit a job to go to another job this is fine. If you are quitting to go 'find' yourself in Australia for a year, you better have a financial plan because you can't live off other peoples' money for your vacation. This system also seems to work well for most people.

In the US, abortion is Constitutionally protected under a person's right to privacy. The details of the laws vary from state to state but there is no place in the US where a person cannot legally and safely obtain an abortion during the first six months of pregnancy.

My stance is that if having a child is a choice, it should be one the parents must prepare for financially before making - just like if they wanted to voluntarily take time off work for other reasons.

We have safety nets for people who are caught in situations they can't control. This is not one of them. Being a parent requires the ability to plan and budget anyway, and it includes many expenses that people will absolutely incur that will not be covered by the hard work of others. It should start with planning to be off work for whatever time having the baby takes.

I completely support peoples' positions being protected while they are off and, quite honestly, think that length of time should be extended from 12 weeks to 24 weeks. But I REALLY don't like the idea of taxpayer dollars being used to support ANYONE who voluntarily leaves work - no matter the reason.

Change My View.

EDIT: I am also against he government mandating that companies provide paid maternity leave on simple Constitutional grounds. In the US the Constitution prohibits the government from mandating this. But I would LOVE it if companies started doing it voluntarily and think it would be a huge positive for attracting top talent. But it should be between employers and employees to figure out compensation packages.

We are lacking in this category compared to other countries. If society as a whole were to voice their concerns about this we would see talks about it. In other countries that has already happened. They understand the benefit of taking care of their society as a whole far outweighs the taxes needed. I for one, would welcome a tax to ensure mothers are taken care of.

This is false. Although it may be something that states should do, plenty have strongly opposed a woman's right to an abortion even going as far as to setup multiple road blocks to delay the process.  
  
No one will advocate for supporting financially stable mothers for years. The whole point of maternity leave is so the mother can be with her child. Mothers go through many chemical changes in their body. Not to mention the massive toll physically and mentally that giving birth takes on the mother. Allowing the mother time to rest and be around her baby is a good thing. If this is her first child, even moreso as she has no idea what she is doing. Asking a mother to work days after she just gave birth is asking for trouble. She is not physically or mentally there. She just experienced a very traumatic experience and the body needs time to rest. All she will want is to be with her child. She may even be extremely stressed from not being to be there and I don't think her job should be able to terminate her because she wants to spend time with her new-born.  
  
All in all, I am massively for paid maternity leave. This country is so far behind in taking care of its citizens it is becoming disgusting. We have one of the worst healthcare systems in the world, unless of course you are wealthy. We turn our backs on veterans that need medical care. We lock up and jail people with mental illnesses. We tell mothers that they're baby isn't important and that they need to suck it up and work. It's such a dangerous mentality we have in this country where everything is me vs. everyone. We need to start taking care of each other instead of saying, ""I got mine, why can't you get yours?"" like each person's situation is exactly the same.","Having a child is a personal and financial sacrifice an individual makes for the rest of their life, but it benefits society in the long run.

We are lacking in this category compared to other countries. If society as a whole were to voice their concerns about this we would see talks about it. In other countries that has already happened. They understand the benefit of taking care of their society as a whole far outweighs the taxes needed. I for one, would welcome a tax to ensure mothers are taken care of.  
  
&gt; In the US, abortion is Constitutionally protected under a person's right to privacy. The details of the laws vary from state to state but there is no place in the US where a person cannot legally and safely obtain an abortion during the first six months of pregnancy.  
  
This is false. Although it may be something that states should do, plenty have strongly opposed a woman's right to an abortion even going as far as to setup multiple road blocks to delay the process.  
  
No one will advocate for supporting financially stable mothers for years. The whole point of maternity leave is so the mother can be with her child. Mothers go through many chemical changes in their body. Not to mention the massive toll physically and mentally that giving birth takes on the mother. Allowing the mother time to rest and be around her baby is a good thing. If this is her first child, even moreso as she has no idea what she is doing. Asking a mother to work days after she just gave birth is asking for trouble. She is not physically or mentally there. She just experienced a very traumatic experience and the body needs time to rest. All she will want is to be with her child. She may even be extremely stressed from not being to be there and I don't think her job should be able to terminate her because she wants to spend time with her new-born.  
  
All in all, I am massively for paid maternity leave. This country is so far behind in taking care of its citizens it is becoming disgusting. We have one of the worst healthcare systems in the world, unless of course you are wealthy. We turn our backs on veterans that need medical care. We lock up and jail people with mental illnesses. We tell mothers that they're baby isn't important and that they need to suck it up and work. It's such a dangerous mentality we have in this country where everything is me vs. everyone. We need to start taking care of each other instead of saying, ""I got mine, why can't you get yours?"" like each person's situation is exactly the same.",r2,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.5,0.6,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.4,0.8,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.0,r1,,
"I'll allow that, in most cases, the misbehaving kid is just throwing a temper tantrum, but what do you do in cases where the kid has thrown himself on the floor in the middle of a restaurant and the waiters are going to trip over him and the parents are refusing to do anything about it? The rest of us have just become too polite of a society and other people who are affected by the bad behavior or might be injured in cases where the kid is throwing things, biting and kicking other people should be justified in disciplining a misbehaving child in a way that doesn't cause welts. Just a few instances of getting knocked on his butt by a complete stranger should be enough to get it through the kid's head that this is not something you do in public.","As a parent of two young children (2 1/2 and 4), I know that children can be highly unpredictable if their routine is broken.

Or you're out for an extended family dinner, or whatever). 

I personally remove my children from the situation/area on the rare occurrences they pitch a major fit in public. I also get very annoyed with parents who ignore their kids in public places when they pull that shit. 

A customer, however, do not know the entire circumstances or get to dictate to me how I deal with my children. If I'm alone with my two children and one is having a meltdown in a restaurant, I need to get the second child at the table packed up to leave as well.

Not to mention there can be extenuating circumstances. I have friends with young children that have mild developmental and mental disorders that can make their behavior unpredictable.

Especially a child could be horrified of going outside in future thinking someone 10 times their size might just hit them to the ground when they're doing something. 

But verbally scolding them or telling them what they are doing is bad is fine in my eyes, but of course the mother/father will rightly so be angry you're going to upset their child. I highly doubt there would be many situations when the parent would feel happy you're treating their child bad.

Basically I think your idea is fine but you'd be going about it wrong.  You should watch the movie whiplash, it has that kind of abusive relationship to force someone to do what they should be doing. I think you might like that, plus it's a good movie.

 If you watch that movie you might be able to see how the child would be feeling in that situation, doing something wrong and being scolded over and over until you finally get it right is a very hard process and most likely won't work unless the person wants to change or is forced to.  Most children will grow out of it and understand what they are doing is wrong once they're forced into a school where behaving normal would be enforced properly, until then it'll mostly be up to the parents.  Your efforts at trying to change them could work amazingly, but most probably be a waste of time.

I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates.  If you want hard questioning, or to know their stand on the issues, interviews from journalists can do that.  Debates are just grandstanding and ""gotchas.""  

A crisis simulation on the other hand would be really useful for getting information about how candidates would do the job of President.  We would see how they asses a situation, how they handle disagreeing advisors, and how deep their knowledge of government runs.

This is also a technique used in a lot of other situations to train and evaluate people who will hold a lot of responsibility.  If you want to be an astronaut, you're going to be doing a lot of simulations.

As far as getting candidates to do it, I could see this being something that a somewhat more obscure candidate does as a way to generate publicity, and which might catch on.   Probably not for the major party candidates for this election cycle, but maybe in the future.

"Most colleges do not require trigonometry for admissions, and do not require students to take a trigonometry course. It seems unfair that the SAT would include this in the math section. Some will argue that it makes sure students are ""well rounded,"" but it's incredibly unfair to use this to test a student's aptitude for college. When I was in high school, I had an 89% overall GPA. I got mid-range scores on the reading and writing sections of the SAT, but did very poorly on the math section. Because of this, I was denied admission to many colleges which I applied to. I understand that my scores in reading and writing were average, but it was the low math score which really hurt my chances of admission. This might seem like a personal argument, but the fact remains that I'm sure many students would agree with me. I understand including algebra and geometry, but I don't see why they include trigonometry. This is a person's future which they are dealing with.

EDIT: Of the five colleges I applied to, I was rejected by two of them, but was accepted by three of them.

To your opening point, the SAT did not prevent you from going to college it just prevented you for attending a more selective college, one that desires a higher level of math knowledge than the ones that accepted you.

"I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at the keys and often hunting and pecking. I personally consider this a major problem because I think it is holding us back to some extent.

Some points that I use to support this argument:

1. Faster typing = more productivity, businesses would benefit. You could do more paperwork, more homework, anything on the computer. I'd argue that if everybody could type, we'd all have more free time as well, or at the very least GDP would increase as we get more work done in less time. 

2. It's useful for personal and professional activities: Even if all you do is type posts on facebook and write an email to your grandkids, knowing how to type will help you.

3. It's easy to learn. It's all muscle memory, and if you practiced for an hour a day you'd be good in a month. Plus there are programs galore for it. 

So, my view is that if university required you to know how to touch-type, perhaps with a modest WPM test on entry, or at least a freshman-year course, people would be forced to learn it and would become better typists, thus benefiting everyone down the line. 

Why university? Because minimum wage workers don't usually need to type on a computer, making it less necessary at the high school level. Also, in university, you'll be typing a hell of a lot. I don't care what course you take, you'll need to type up essays and ultimately a thesis paper. 

Am I overblowing this? To quote the great Mugatu, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. To me it's at least as important as learning how to write with a pen these days. I'd just like to understand why society currently seems to place no value in this skill, and that maybe I'm overreacting. 

**Edit 1**

Well, thanks for all the comments, it's been a very interesting discussion so far. 

The argument that's hanging onto me the most is that the keyboard may become obsolete, but I can't see that happening soon enough to justify ignoring a useful skill.

For those who point out that we can learn it of our own free will and it's not the university's place, I feel that the long-term benefits of such a policy change benefit us in the long term. Universities often require you to study other things they feel are beneficial, such as learning another language (which is often taught inadequately), so I don't feel that it's outside the potential scope of a university to require typing.

And for those pointing out that it isn't worth the time, I maintain that learning costs next to nothing, and it saves you time over the course of your life if you add up every time you type.

**Edit 2, View Changed**

/u/cheeseboyardee made the point that not everyone learns at the same rate and some people may not be able to learn to type well, and thus mandating it could exclude otherwise capable people. 

Thanks for all the posts and cordial discussion.

And still appreciate what Win8 was trying to do.  So my arguments more or less here are to understand why there are a lot of people who hate it.  I think it's also worth mentioning that Win8 brings a lot of great things to the table (new explorer, new task manager, better under the hood performance, etc) but depending on the person, they probably don't care.

&gt; The main complaint seems to be the start screen replacing the start menu.

The problem is that it's considered a really jarring experience for a lot of people, and they don't like that.  So in order to access your programs in Win7 if they weren't pinned to the bar you could just open up the menu while still having a complete view of the desktop.  With Win8 however, going into the Start Screen completely tears you out of your working environment so you can access your programs not pinned to the bar.  So for some that only have a handful of programs pinned to their Start it's incredibly annoying to have an *entire* screen fill up your desktop rather than a small menu on the side.

Another issue (which I still kinda have with it, even though it doesn't happen often) is when you accidentally hit the Win key it pulls you out of whatever you're working on and into a completely different screen.  In Win7 if this happened all you'd see is the menu pop up and you'd just click off it to get back to work.  In Win8 you have to find the Desktop tile and click that, or strike the key again.  The process is non-ideal.

I also feel that it could have been executed a lot better as far as tile organization goes.  You can do two sizes, and stack them in a column.  I think they should have taken the ""snap to grid"" approach for icons on the desktop to allow you to stick tiles anywhere on the Start screen rather than just form columns and hope they align with your OCD.

&gt;  if you really hate it you can install something like classic shell to bring back to the start menu

I'm an advocate of this, however you have to remember that the majority of PC users are *not* incredibly bright.  So for instance if my father wanted to get a new laptop then he's got to figure all that stuff out on his own (not likely), I need to babysit him through the process on the phone, or I need to just do it myself.  And since it's a third party software, it's possible that it'll break for one reason or another in which case either he's got to fix it (not likely) or I need to fix it (annoying).

&gt; To change my view here you should tell me if there's something worse than the start screen in Windows 8 that makes it that bad. Or if the start screen really is that bad.

So depends on who you are.  I don't mind the Start screen but there are a lot of people who absolutely *loathe* it.

Other things wrong with Win8:

 - Charms menu.  Every time my cursor wanders over to a corner I get an annoying Charms menu pop up.  If I have a multi monitor setup (which I do now) if I *do* want to get to the Charms I have to balance my cursor between screens, making it nearly impossible to get on a single try.  It's also kinda useless.  I've nearly forgotten it's there on my desktop since all of its functionality is available elsewhere (at least from what I've used).
 - Lack of Start button (fixed with 8.1).  In Win8 there was no Start button, so the only way to get to the Start menu was hitting the Win key or going all the way to the corner with the cursor.  Annoying.
 - Shut down (fixed in 8.1, kinda).  In Win8 if you want to restart/shut down/sleep it's a several key/click process.  You need to get to the start menu, then open the charms bar, then select settings, then power options, then select what you wanna do.  It's a kind of hidden process, and really annoying if you don't know how to do it.  Once you do know, you think ""why is this a several step process when it should be like Win7?"".  Win 8.1 *kinda* fixes this by allowing you direct access with a right click of the Start button, or directly on the Start Screen.  I say *kinda* because a right click is non-ideal and non-obvious and putting it on the Start screen means you still need to use the Start Screen.
 - Direct to Start Screen on boot (fixed in 8.1, with a settings change).  Booting up goes right to the Start Screen rather than the desktop.  Annoying.  Fixed with a settings option in 8.1, but it should be default.
 - Full screen apps (kinda fixed with 8.1).  Full screen apps on a desktop (or even laptop) are a terrible idea.  Win 8.1 kinda fixes this by docking them on the taskbar, but full screen apps are still a terrible idea.  They need to be windowed or the option to have them windowed, period.  For someone who wants to look at more than one thing (laptop and desktop users) having Mail taking up your entire screen is a drag.
 - General hidden features.  Things that should be obvious are hidden.  You need to hunt a corner to pop a menu out, accessing ""all apps"" from the Start Screen there's a *hidden* arrow button, right clicking contextually to find things (like the shut down point before) etc.  Not to mention all the stuff buried in the Charms bar.  There's too much hidden stuff that's only nice if you already know where it is.
 - General touch-oriented approach.  A lot of stuff is designed with touch in mind, like the Tiles.  Great if you have a touchscreen, and janky looking if you don't. 
 - Too much tied in with MS.  They really try to get you to make an MS account, and tie your login with said account.  I absolutely hate that.  It makes things like Onedrive on the desktop inaccessible because of this integration, as opposed to just having the application take whatever credentials it needs.  If you chose to shirk making and signing in with an MS account, you lose some of the perks Win8 brings to the table.
 - Multiple PC settings areas.  So you've got the standard Control Panel, then you've got this ""Settings"" area that has some repetition from Control Panel, then some other stuff not in Control Panel that should be integrated into just Control Panel.  It's also a full screen app...ughhhh.  So if you wanna set something, you have to hunt through an already kinda cryptic Control Panel, but also through this new Settings app.
 - Repetition of functionality.  There's a lot of different ways to do one thing.  Shut down is yet again an example of this.  Device management is another (Control Panel, Settings app, Charms bar).  Search is another (Win+S, Start menu then type something, Charms bar).  There is way too much repetition.

So all in all, if you're not a savvy user (like most) then updating is a real pain in the ass.  8.1 does fix a lot of flaws 8 had, and Win10 supposedly brings a lot of that stuff even closer to Win7 (Start menu).  Win10 is what Win8 should have been.

And in reality, there's ways around just about every nit up there.  Problem is, that if you have to find a way around something in order to get to experience the better things and improvements Win8 has to offer then that's a bad thing and deserving of a lot of the hate that Win8 has garnered.","In 1994-1995, there were a bunch of ""alternative shell"" programs launched for Windows 3.1. Most prominent among them were Microsoft Bob and Packard Bell Navigator.

They were intended to make computers simpler, friendlier, easier to use thanks to more familiar UI elements.

They were a massive failure, in part because their supposedly-intuitive UIs were anything but, and in part because they were so limited—a lot of functionality was buried, you had no idea what you could or couldn't interact with or what anything would do, and you just couldn't do certain things without exiting the ""friendly"" UI and returning to the real OS.

Windows 8 is that, but worse. It's grafted into the OS, rather than merely overlaying it. It's mostly ignorable, but there's just enough designed-for-touchscreen elements (which are explained... once... the first time the computer ever turns on while running that version of Windows) that are vital to day-to-day life that you can't just pretend it doesn't exist. Like the Charms menu in order to reboot or power down, or tying the native web browser and SkyDrive to the new ""modern"" UI, or the nightmare that is trying to sort the start screen. Even if you like the new start screen—I personally think it looks pretty nifty—it's not really very *good.* (I always preferred Launchy to the Start Menu, so that wasn't a problem for me, but it's certainly a problem for a lot of other people.)

And that half-baked, Frankenstein's monster of a solution was really a shame. I liked Windows 8. I still like Windows 8, and I'm looking forward to Windows 10—the improvements to network file sharing code, file move/copy, the task manager, and overall RAM use are all really good benefits, and bumping my work computer from 7 to 10 is going to be a delight. But 8 was badly-designed software, even if you could ignore most of the bad parts if you knew what you were doing.",206,"Let me start by saying I'm a fan of Win *8.1* (the .1 being the key there).  And still appreciate what Win8 was trying to do.  So my arguments more or less here are to understand why there are a lot of people who hate it.  I think it's also worth mentioning that Win8 brings a lot of great things to the table (new explorer, new task manager, better under the hood performance, etc) but depending on the person, they probably don't care.

&gt; The main complaint seems to be the start screen replacing the start menu.

The problem is that it's considered a really jarring experience for a lot of people, and they don't like that.  So in order to access your programs in Win7 if they weren't pinned to the bar you could just open up the menu while still having a complete view of the desktop.  With Win8 however, going into the Start Screen completely tears you out of your working environment so you can access your programs not pinned to the bar.  So for some that only have a handful of programs pinned to their Start it's incredibly annoying to have an *entire* screen fill up your desktop rather than a small menu on the side.

Another issue (which I still kinda have with it, even though it doesn't happen often) is when you accidentally hit the Win key it pulls you out of whatever you're working on and into a completely different screen.  In Win7 if this happened all you'd see is the menu pop up and you'd just click off it to get back to work.  In Win8 you have to find the Desktop tile and click that, or strike the key again.  The process is non-ideal.

I also feel that it could have been executed a lot better as far as tile organization goes.  You can do two sizes, and stack them in a column.  I think they should have taken the ""snap to grid"" approach for icons on the desktop to allow you to stick tiles anywhere on the Start screen rather than just form columns and hope they align with your OCD.

"My logic is pretty simple. People who believe that someone is selfish for committing or wanting to commit suicide just because it makes those around them sad then they are actually the ones who are selfish because they'd rather someone suffer than have them end their misery and be forced to grieve their death. I think there are instances where suicide is selfish (people who have children that still rely on them) but if you have no responsibilities such as that then it could be your reasons are actually very selfless. Furthermore I think that calling people who struggle with suicidal thoughts ""selfish"" is extremely insensitive and misguided as I'd tend to believe that most people who off themselves are doing it for reasons they perceive to be for the greater good.

"A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a Uzi submachine gun on full automatic.

From some comments various people have left on this and the reporting it seems that it is not unusual for kids even younger then that to shoot real firearms.

This is ridiculous. Children (and I define that in this case as everyone under 18) are not nearly responsible enough to handle them. There is a reason we do not let little children drive cars or drink alcohol etc.

Childrens Brains (and even young adult's, but you have to draw the line somewhere) are still in the process of developing. We all have done stupid shit as children. Hell, just here on reddit I read about some guy who shot his brother *twice* as a kid. You may choose not be believe that story, but for me it seems plausible.

I know btw that the Instructor in this case made some critical mistakes as well, and that children shooting firearms have to be supervised. But still, if the Girl had the experiance, wisdom and patience that comes with being an adult, this would have never happened. 

An adult acts as another layer of protection to prevent an accident. In my view, having a child handle a firearm is a little like not exercising proper trigger discipline. If you do everything else right, nothing bad can really happen. But you should never rely on doing everything else right.

You might know some very mature and patient 14 year old who is really interested in hunting or sport shooting. In that case, congratulations. But I still stand by my view that that kid should wait and grow four more years. Sure, they might not get to shoot for four your years, but nobody will die.

EDIT:

/u/caw81 has slightly changed my view. Now I think only people under the age of 16 should be barred.

EDIT 2:

/u/incruente and /u/Zorthianator have completely changed my view.

"I just watched *The Imitation Game* (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it ... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was pretty annoyed to discover that [aspects of the film's plot were warped for the purpose of making it more dramatic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game#Accuracy). I do not think any good comes of this, and to be honest it makes me quite mad. For example, in the film, the main character Alan Turing is portrayed by the actor as obviously autistic to some extent, but according to a quote on Wikipedia (not sure exactly who said it) ""the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film ... bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing"". This, I think, is insulting to Turing's memory, to customise his personality as to make the film more interesting or to make the audience more sympathetic towards his character.

Sometimes it's less minor than character modification. I distinctly remember watching *13 Days* (2000) in a high school history class to supplement our Cold War study. This film ramped up the 'Soviets are evil and JFK is a god' theme to the point of including an entirely fictional battle scene, but went out of its way to present itself as a historically accurate film, including real Cold War footage throughout. We watched it in history class for god's sake! It's also been criticised for attributing a major role in the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis to Kenneth O'Donnell - somebody who was *actually there* argues that ""For God's sakes, Kenny O'Donnell didn't have any role whatsoever ... that's absurd."" I think overblowing or underplaying real people's roles in history is just insulting, and cannot be justified.

Thus, **I am suggesting that films which are 'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred.**

I will pre-argue some anticipated arguments in advance:

* ""They're claiming to be *based* on a true story, not perfectly historically accurate."" 

Yes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films *appear* as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can). It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun.

* ""The aim of a film is to entertain, it is not meant to be a history lesson.""

But to some extent, they are taken as such all the same. A person who knows *absolutely nothing* about JFK will undoubtedly feel at least somewhat more knowledgable after sitting down and watching *JFK* (1991). And you know what, they *should* feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.

* ""It would be boring if we saw films about the events as they actually happened.""

Suck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary. If you want action, watch Avengers. Don't ever watch *Pearl Harbour* (2001). A quote from Wikipedia regarding that film: 'the producer Jerry Bruckheimer was quoted saying, ""We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson"".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?

Okay, I think I've ranted (more than) enough. I need to stop raging about so many movies (don't even get me started on *Pocahontas* (1995) and *Argo* (2012)) - please CMV!

**EDIT: Great chatting everyone! Bad history will still annoy me forevermore, but nonetheless my view has been Changed! The most convincing arguments for me were that it would be incredibly difficult to draw the line between what is minor enough that the director has artistic license and what isn't, and that ALL secondary sources of history are a matter of perspective and interpretation anyway, as well as many other valuable and insightful arguments. Thanks for playing!**

They're not lying to anyone when they throw the ""based on"" in front of the ""true story"".  So since it's a movie and they're telling you outright it's a dramatization then there's no reason to go through the song and dance of verifying it as 100% factual.  Things that are 100% factual would be a documentary, which these movies are not advertised as.

&gt; Yes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth'

But the tagline isn't ""based on truth"", the tagline is ""based on a true *story*"".  Of which, the original story may or may not even be 100% factual on what actually happened.  People exaggerate and mislead in their recounting of events all the time.  So I would have to say that calling something ""based on a true story"" is a level removed in facts than saying ""based on truth"".  The story is just a sequence of events that happened at some point in time, not down to the detail what actually happened.

&gt; And you know what, they should feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.

Is there an inherent problem with getting some facts wrong or leaving them out?  Since it's a movie do you expect people going to see these films are going there to be educated or are going to just be entertained?  If they're going to be entertained then why are you worried about the factualness of the story?

&gt; Suck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary. If you want action, watch Avengers. Don't ever watch Pearl Harbour (2001).

What if I don't want to watch a Sci-Fi action film?  What if I want to watch Saving Private Ryan -esque movies that aren't documentaries?  Things like Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, and other war movies/shows tend to be based on something so why do I only have the choice between a History Channel special on WWII or nothing at all?  Because to be completely honest, I would imagine a 100% factual movie about WWII would have either a *lot* of people just sitting around waiting for stuff to happen or would just be a hogepodge of battle scenes that don't really make a story.

I'm curious if you also hold the same standards for science.  Do you get really angry at space movies that fly things like planes and have fire or sound while people are floating around in the void?  I could go on about all the things those movies get wrong.  And I think that's a bit more grievous considering they actually *break physics*.  But in the end, it's entertainment.

&gt; It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun.

Actually, it really should. In any capacity. We should not be in the business of encouraging people to swallow stories wholesale, whether they find them in the theater, on the internet, in a book, or in the paper. If you are endeavouring to discover the ""true story"", you should already be looking at multiple sources. This isn't even a difficult thing to do - you managed to do it with a quick wikipedia search.



&gt;People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films appear as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can).

How someone interprets the word ""based"" is not the responsibility of the filmmaker. All the simulacrum in the world does not change basic definitions.



&gt; If you want to learn history, want a documentary.

While it's true that documentaries are often held to a higher standard than historical films, this does not make them infallible. A lot of what passes under the genre of ""documentary"" is heavily biased, or even outright doctored. Films do you the courtesy of letting you know they are fabricated, whereas any fabrication in documentaries is presented as unvarnished truth. Should we ban documentaries too?  



&gt;""We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson"".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?

Because people are interested in history, but they are also interested in the human condition, and how people relate to one another. Sometimes, they would prefer this to historical accuracy. Pearl Harbour's main purpose was to tell a story of love in a time of war - the focus was on human drama, and not historical accuracy. It's perfectly fine to criticize them about this, but why would you get outraged over Bruckheimer being honest about his intentions? He *should* be coming forward to clarify that history is his backdrop and not his subject. I'd be more infuriated if he was *not* up front about this. 




I'm not going to say that people can't be easily misled, because they certainly can. But what is the alternative? 100% accuracy in all things? In many historical cases we can't even form a working consensus on what happened, or for what reason - that doesn't eliminate the ancient drive to tell stories about our history. If filmmakers want to be as accurate as possible they can - the Band of Brothers series comes to mind. But if they would prefer not to, and are happy to tell us that they are not even trying, what's the problem?",209,"&gt; I am suggesting that films which are 'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred.

They're not lying to anyone when they throw the ""based on"" in front of the ""true story"".  So since it's a movie and they're telling you outright it's a dramatization then there's no reason to go through the song and dance of verifying it as 100% factual.  Things that are 100% factual would be a documentary, which these movies are not advertised as.

&gt; Yes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth'

But the tagline isn't ""based on truth"", the tagline is ""based on a true *story*"".  Of which, the original story may or may not even be 100% factual on what actually happened.  People exaggerate and mislead in their recounting of events all the time.  So I would have to say that calling something ""based on a true story"" is a level removed in facts than saying ""based on truth"".  The story is just a sequence of events that happened at some point in time, not down to the detail what actually happened.

&gt; And you know what, they should feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.

Is there an inherent problem with getting some facts wrong or leaving them out?  Since it's a movie do you expect people going to see these films are going there to be educated or are going to just be entertained?  If they're going to be entertained then why are you worried about the factualness of the story?

&gt; Suck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary. If you want action, watch Avengers. Don't ever watch Pearl Harbour (2001).

What if I don't want to watch a Sci-Fi action film?  What if I want to watch Saving Private Ryan -esque movies that aren't documentaries?  Things like Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, and other war movies/shows tend to be based on something so why do I only have the choice between a History Channel special on WWII or nothing at all?  Because to be completely honest, I would imagine a 100% factual movie about WWII would have either a *lot* of people just sitting around waiting for stuff to happen or would just be a hogepodge of battle scenes that don't really make a story.

"1. Squatting is more comfortable, easier and healthier than sitting. it creates less stress on the the puborectalis muscle allowing for a smoother uninterrupted experience. it plays well with gravity so less pressure is needed and lowers the risk of cancer and other ailments.

2. Toilet paper is messy, expensive and damages the environment. When washed properly the use of your hand is preferable to toilet paper, It might sound disgusting but when you think about it using a thin piece of frail paper to smear around fecal matter with no water or soap is even worse. 

3. Modern europen toilets are large, bulky and complex. They take more space, require more maintenance and are ultimately dirtier as butts keep touching them.

* I'm not restricting this purely to retail, but retail teaches humility.  It teaches you how to be diplomatic, how you're not the center of the universe, sometimes you have to tolerate shit, things won't always go your way.  And after working a retail job, you'll treat other retail workers with more respect.

* Having a job also teaches the reality of the world versus theory.  I used to be a hardcore Republican who thought poor people didn't have it THAT bad and wealthy people deserve to live 100x better because they work harder.  Now, I see the real challenges average people face, especially in the ghetto.

* Having real world experience will help you just as much (you'll encounter lots of people, learn your strengths and weaknesses), if not more than spending years in college ""finding yourself"".  If you have no idea what you want to do in college, you're going to waste lots of time.

* Lots of college kids are entitled because parents/government pay for everything.  And they think they automatically deserve a high-paying job just because they graduated.  Nope, gotta work your way up from the bottom.  Nobody's too good for an entry-level job.

* Oh, and it doesn't hurt to have a little more on your resume.

"Hi CMV! A recent post on AskReddit about homosexuality and pedophilia being a choice or not led me to this thought that BOTH homosexuality and heterosexuality are choice made by our subconscious minds. I KNOW how this view will bring up other ethical/moral/rights issues, but read the following before lambasting me:
               
What if the human mind starts as a blank sheet of paper at age zero, but everyone has different genes that give them different tendencies towards different sexualities? So as the human mind engages with the constructed world, as the baby/kid interacts with different types of people, play different toys, watches different cartoons, etc, the mind gets molded accordingly. NOW I know how this opinion will lead to the justification of actions such as churches ""training"" homosexuals back to being a ""normal"" person, but I think that this ""molding of the mind"" only happens to humans before we reach full-consciousness. (Yes, I realize this still doesn't absolve the justification) So, beyond a certain age, the human mind is then more or less ""fixed” and it is then hard to change it.

My opinion is based on little or no knowledge on topics such as human genetics, neuroplasticity, and human psychology. So please CMV!

EDIT: Delta awarded to /u/RustyRook , and thanks for the discussion guys! I now believe that the word ""choice"" isn't the best word to use when it comes to arguments like this. Even if a baby is thrown a bunch of toys and cartoons to play with and watch, s/he doesn't consciously think ""OK, from this moment onwards, I'm gay/straight"" (assuming that the toys/cartoon/culture/environment do even influence the sexual orientation of the child).

I'm not saying that environment, upbringing, etc. don't play a big role in determining a person's preferences. What I am saying is that most people don't get to consciously choose their sexuality. For most heterosexuals there isn't much introspection involved. For homosexuals and bisexuals, there is often a higher degree of introspection involved, but members of either group didn't sit down one day and decide to go one way or the other.

You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that mainly talk about how the other party/candidate would be bad for this country, the ads I have a problem with are **endorsed** by a political party that used taxpayer money to attack another political party. I think that to use taxpayer to further your own agenda is wrong.

I think that instead of using money to fund public dialogues that they can put on public networks, this would allow them to talk about what problems they have with other parties with the the other parties having the ability to respond and rebuttle if they have proof that they are wrong. 

I am also not that smart so I would love to hear any problems with my logic! CMV reddit

"There is an increasing trend in the UK of 'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a certificate and to celebrate that milestone, and as such should be restricted to University courses, and at a push to cover people at the end of High School (so that the people who go straight into work celebrate an end of their formal education).

I appreciate that schools and the pupils want to celebrate the end of their time at that school, but placing children in garishly-coloured robes at the age of 7 only cheapens what a 'graduation' stands for. **There are other ways they can celebrate a new beginning without appropriating and trampling on existing ceremonies and traditions**

To give a comparison, consider how engineers in the US and Canada are given an iron ring in a ceremony to symbolise their obligation. The ring and the associated ceremony is a very personal symbol of their choices and achievements to the engineers. Now imagine how they would feel if every single infant school started copying their ceremony word for word, item for item, issuing iron rings to 7 year olds telling them it means the same.

My son is supposed to have a 'graduation' in a few months, and the vast majority of the parents are planning a boycott, organising their own event in its place. We can't even find out where this tradition started, or why.

"I have a general feeling about whether a person has experienced living without ego or not by observation of where they place the importance of their own wants against the needs of others. From this, it is my belief that a person cannot be actively compassionate in every day life when they have not experienced the falseness of self because the ego is the only self they are truly aware of.

Compassion being defined as being able to possess a love for all beings that is as great as that for the self and the closest people in their lives.

Truly compassionate being defined as actively compassionate in every day life for all those that they can have an effect on.","If we are to take something like Dunbar's Number seriously, that is, to assume there is a physical limit of our ability to understand the social connections between people known to the individual, then it follows that other socially-dependent concepts, like empathy and compassion, also have their limits, in that they can only be applied in their totality to a limited number of things. You are physically incapable of understanding and having compassion for *every single living thing*, rather, in order to have the compassion of the type you've defined, the individual must create for themselves an idea or representation that stands in place for that complete understanding. They must substitute what they do understand, which in this case is the ""love"" they have for themselves and those they do know, to fill in gaps for what they are incapable of understanding.

What that means is that the person who is feeling compassion for all living things, as a matter of physiology, is in fact *not* doing such, as much as they are creating a heuristic for ""compassionate"" behavior. They love *the idea of ""all living things""* because they cannot understand what ""all living things"" actually represents, much less have feelings for. This process is wholly dependent on the ego - a lack of self concept means lacking the ability to do that substitution.

However, that leaves unanswered the question of whether a temporary suspension of the ego is necessary to create an effective heuristic for compassionate behavior. I argue ""no"". There is nothing to suggest, on a conceptual level, that the forming of such a pattern of behavior necessitates experiencing something like the ""ego death"" often attributed (though not exclusive) to LSD, Ayahuasca, dissociatives, etc.  It would seem to be the case that a supreme ego is necessary, one which is able to substitute for a lack of knowledge of others the knowledge of itself, and act as though it were interacting with a being of the same makeup. Temporary suspension may be *helpful*, but you haven't demonstrated any reason for thinking one is incapable of doing this kind of ""ego substitution"" without this experience.

It doesn't exactly seem well founded or explained in your post.

Why can a person who hasn't experienced egolessness be truly compassionate?

Why has your mushroomtrip or whatever made you able to be more ""truly"" compassionate then someone who hasn't?

Are you (or others who can be truly compassionate) actively more compassionate then everyone else? Or is your quality of compassion better?

"The old tipping debate. I generally side with those that want to end the mostly American practice of tipping about 20% percent of the cost of the meal. That may never happen.

What bothers me, is the idea that the server's time is as only as valuable as the cost of what's on the plate. If I get a $8 plate of eggs at Waffle House I am to tip about 2 dollars. If I am to get a $50 steak at the local trendy restaurant or steak house, I am to tip over $10? 

I understand that *generally* at a more expensive restaurant I will spend more time there making the servers work a longer time on my needs. And they are usually expected to be more knowledgeable about the menu. And the bus has to make thing look better and the bartender has to know more cocktails....

But it seems to me, the tipping tradition has propped up a non-egalitarian system where the young and attractive can rake in a decent pay check because expensive restaurants can be exclusive about hiring, and others, especially the older who probably did not really want to be stuck server their whole career, are left taking the 15% on my cheap dinner.

If I go in simply for a beer and a dessert, I try to tip above 50%. For ""affordable"" dinners I try to tip 25-30%. For nicer dinners I usually end up tip 15-20%. Truly bad service and I will only tip 10-15%. And if they have a truly helpful suggestion at that trendy restaurant I may tip over 20%.....

I think we should move to a system based more on how long you are in the restaurant, and the amount of attention your visit actually needed, rather than a simple percentage completely isolated from the nuance of the service.

But the whole system just makes me feel guilty.","Let me start by saying I tip well even when ordering at a counter.

i somewhat agree with you But if it is based on time and I buy a beer and pay with exact cash shouldn't I be paying next to nothing? 

At a restaurant you are tipping a waiter, bus boys, cooks, and hosts. The reason it works is at nicer restaurants there are more employees doing the same job. You pay more for your meal and your higher tip goes to more people. 

Obviously the best case scenario would be to just have a livable wage. 

Here is an interesting thought though. In cities that are raising their minimum wages to $15 an hour am I still going to be expected to tip well? It seems to be that food service employees are going to be ridiculously well compensated for a job that takes no skills. Especially in San Fransisco where restaurants are required to also provide health care for their employees.

","I am of two minds about tipping. On the one hand, it's getting very confusing with different people wanting tips, mainly because no one can live on minimum wage, and there being different rates depending on the work they do. On the other hand, I've traveled to places that didn't have tipping, and the service is not nearly as good. So I think tipping encourages good service, because the reward is immediate.

However, if we have tipping, I don't think it's unfair to base the amount on the total cost of the meal. High-end restaurants with high-end prices tend to hire for quality far more than low-end restaurants do. So in the server business, you start at a cheap chain restaurant and work your way up. By the time you get to the higher end restaurants, service is a high priority. Part of the service is that you are invisible but provide for the diner's needs without being intrusive. Therefore, you don't need to be particularly attractive, or young. You need to look well groomed, and keep your hair under control for health department reasons. But you don't have to be beautiful or handsome. You have to be good.

Also, waiters at really high-end restaurants do not have four or five tables to serve at one time. They have one or two.They will stand somewhere that you won't notice them and watch, so they can be there exactly when you want them, and even before you realize you want something, and they already have it. So they have to make more money per table to make it worth it. They are not running around as much as the waiter at Chili's, but they are exercising skill as they anticipate needs. And if there were no tipping, you could rest assured that the high-end restaurants would pay their wait staff more so that they could get the best. And you would pay them more in your bill.

Despite its flaws, the current system does account for skill and level of attention. The no-tip system, in my experience, results in lesser levels of service, but would mean that better waiters got paid better at restaurants that demand a higher level of service. A flat-rate or time-based system like you propose would be more complicated than a no-tip system and still not account for the differences between having to flag your waiter down at Chili's to ask for more ketchup and having your needs anticipated at a high-end restaurant.

"I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still hold its unacceptable to break the law the way BLM did. 

My friend argued back that since both of us are white, we can never understand the situation and the anger these representatives of BLM feel. Therefore, she argued, we cannot criticize their actions since we cannot and can never understand their perspective.

My friend showed me [this article](http://time.com/3605606/ferguson-in-defense-of-rioting/) in defense of her argument. I'll quote from the conclusion,

&gt;Instead of tearing down other human beings who are acting upon decades of pent-up anger at a system decidedly against them, a system that has told them they are less than human for years, we ought to be reaching out to help them regain the humanity they lost, not when a few set fire to the buildings in Ferguson, but when they were born the wrong color in the post-racial America.

In response to the article, I essentially argued that while I do feel for minorities in the U.S, violence is neither a morally sound or pragmatic way to go about change. I also felt that the argument presented (we are not minorities, therefore we will never be able to understand, therefore we cannot criticize) is fundamentally unsound.

I'd love to hear some support for her viewpoint, because I am an open-minded person and I care about racial equality America

I think it's also worth acknowledging that the context and audience of your criticism.

If you're talking to a group of black people as a white person, it's worth keeping in mind that your ethos may not be very strong.

"This view of mine might sound obvious or simple but I think a lot of sensitive, complex social issues have simple underlying causes that are often ignored. In fact, I think they are so often ignored that I start to doubt my own view, hence this post. I'm a little embarrassed to share it. Here's my basic line of thought:

* Stereotypes exist because the generalization is accurate.
* Several of society's popular problems are blamed on other people acting with an awareness of stereotypes, or the stereotypes themselves.
* A lot of cases regarding these problems are caused or made worse by the victim acting in accordance with a stereotype while blaming either the stereotype or something else.
* If people made more of a conscious effort to not act in accordance with a stereotype in a situation where the stereotype could be considered relevant less incidents would occur.
* When less incidents occur the stereotype changes or evaporates completely. 

'Victim' is somewhat of a loose term here (I'm excluding people who are indirectly involved with an incident pertaining to whatever social ill anyone might refer to) so before you shout ""victim blaming!"" I'll freely state that yes, I believe victims are *very rarely* 100% free from some kind of responsibility. 

An example would be a black man being pulled over in a bad neighborhood and getting ticketed, arrested, or worse after arguing with/ resisting the police officer. We *might* be able to argue the man was unfairly profiled, but we can't prove something like that. It's much easier to take preventative measures (respect and compliance with the officer, no matter how shitty of a person they may be) and either avoid the situation completely or not make it harder than it needs to be. But once the black driver starts getting loud and upset, in the cops mind he's just another loud black person (fulfilling the stereotype) which could lead the officer to believe that the driver fulfills other aspects of his stereotype. 

Another quick example would be the stereotype of men only being interested in sex and men saying ""not all men are pigs."" Well, if that stereotype upsets you as a man, the only thing you can really do that will have any kind of effect is to not be a pig! But nobody seems to realize this, they just want everyone else to do what they ask. 

Obviously I'm not proposing an over-night fix to any social issue, but what I'm proposing would benefit our society a lot more than victims telling everyone else to stop stereotyping. Pointing the finger at the aggressor(s) doesn't actually help solve the whole problem; all that does is either end that individual incident or piss people off. That shortsightedness does absolutely nothing to solve the problem on any kind of large, lasting scale. 

I'm happy to edit for any needed clarification.

"I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a ""slut"" the poster gets railed for it. I also don't think it is strictly the language being used. Regardless of the label, not wanting your partner to have been with 5+ people is 100% defensible. If we, as a society, can tell people that being tall is attractive or that being fat is unattractive, we can tell being that sleeping around is unattractive.     

Another logically invalid argument is that the person with the preference, must not be promiscuous themselves. I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he's hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner's choice in me, we can like different things. Many physically fit men are ""chubby-chasers"" and man slutty men are virginal chasers. 


Edit: To clarify, the use of the words ""slut"" earlier was merely a reflection of the term as it has been used on Reddit. I do not view a persons' worth as tied to their sexual history. I also don't have an moral qualms towards premarital sex or number of sexual partners. That said, my personal level of attraction is affected.

For instance, a man can have an internal, silent preference for lean women, but depending on the context, if he vocalizes it, he is likely to receive criticism.

Women who have a preference for tall men tend to face less open criticism for that preference, even when voiced openly.

Both genders tend to not be criticized for openly wanting an intelligent and/or successful partner, in the same way that both genders are essentially never criticized for not wanting a dumb loser.

These socially accepted preferences change over time, and what you are identifying is a universally condemned attribute transitioning out of that realm. For most of history, sexual promiscuity in women has been universally condemnable, and so it's not unexpected to have a large portion of people who still ascribe to that social custom. As customs go, there is no ""correct"" viewpoint. 

As western society has grown more progressive, this particularly female heavy bias against promiscuity has begun to equalize, and we are simply in the tumultuous transition period. There are plenty of people who say it makes zero difference in their choice, and plenty of people who only consider someone who is a virgin. Both are merely choices.

As far as your view goes, I don't necessarily disagree with your position, but I disagree with your oversimplification. 

Slut is a subjective term. Ask 10 people what it means and the only common thread will be sexual promiscuity. There will be a wide range of pejorative attitudes about the term, but the problem lies in the fact that it is exclusively an insult that gets wrongly applied to people with multiple sexual partners.

Consider a young woman, who is 32, and has had only serious boyfriends her whole life. She started dating at 16, lost her virginity to her first boyfriend, and has had a sexual relationship with each of her boyfriends, with a consistent duration of approximately 18-24 months per bf. This gives her a sexual partner range of 8-11 (rounding up). Now, to many people, the number 11 could seem like a high ""slutty"" number, when in reality she has merely had a long string of moderately long, monogamous relationships, that even allow for something as conservative as a 6-month waiting period before sex.

Consider another person, who had one serious relationship at 16, lost their virginity, broke up when she went to college, and then drunkenly slept with 5 guys in her first year. The next year she met her college sweetheart, and they stayed together for 12 years before breaking up. She is now roughly as old as the first woman, yet has only 7 partners. However, the means at which she got to her 7 as opposed the the other woman's 11 is monumentally different.

So while it doesn't necessarily mean nothing, it is a worthless metric without context. As both those women have had very different sexual pasts, and if you were taking either one of them on a date at 32, their respective pasts would mean very different things to you. 

Now, to bring it back to the word slut, you can see how using that word to describe either of them would mean **very** different things. One of them had a very slow accumulation of partners through 1.5-2 year relationships, and the other had the vast majority of all her partners during one short burst in college, with the previous decade+ being solely monogamous.","I've read through many of the comments here, and I appreciate that you have awarded several deltas. I hope the perspective I can offer on this is different enough from what has already been said to be of value to you. 

Here's my take. You state in your OP that preferences such as height and weight are generally accepted in our society. Absolutely true. You say in a comment that smoking is a deal breaker for you, that you would never date a woman who smokes. Fair enough. You also say this:

&gt;A context that came to mind when writing it is the /r/relationship[1] posts where the partner learns after-the-fact that his girlfriend/wife (or her husband/boyfriend) had more partners than originally assumed.

To me, the difference is that physical appearance and smoking affect you in the present. I could see deciding not to date someone because they have a reputation for promiscuity or because you correlate a higher number of sexual partners with an increased proclivity to cheat or an inability to maintain a healthy relationship. I'm not saying these correlations are correct, but I could understand your hesitation. However, in the scenarios you described, your wife or girlfriend is presumably a woman with whom you have built a solid trust, who has proven herself to be faithful and capable of being a partner. I can understand being upset if she lied to you about the number in the past, but even in this case, empathy suggests that she was probably embarrassed or fearful of judgment/rejection. In your scenario, breaking up with the girl for the number of sexual partners she has had is more accurately comparable with breaking up with her because she used to be fat or because she is an ex-smoker. A person can't change that they used to be fat or that they used to smoke or unsleep with past sexual partners, but they can lose weight and quit smoking and build a healthy monogamous relationship.

I also have qualms with this argument:

&gt;Another logically invalid argument is that the person with the preference, must not be promiscuous themselves. I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he's hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner's choice in me, we can like different things. Many physically fit men are ""chubby-chasers"" and man slutty men are virginal chasers.

What if instead of your example of physically fit men who are chubby-chasers, we are talking about obese women who only want to date men with six-pack abs? Or obese men who only want to date models? Yes, they are still entitled to have that preference, but most of us won't be surprised or particularly sympathetic when they don't find a partner. It is hypocritical because they want a partner who takes care of their body, but are not willing to put in the effort themselves. In the same respect, it is hypocritical for you to want a partner who has maintained her chastity, while not be willing to put forth the same effort. Women have a desire for sex too, and I think it is reasonable in this scenario to compare resisting the temptation to have sex with resisting the temptation to eat junk food or watch TV/play video games instead of going to the gym.

Lastly, I have one more angle to approach this from. With emerging adulthood and people getting married later, 5+ sexual partners is not necessarily promiscuous. Expecting a woman to be a virgin or have a very low number of previous sexual partners was much more reasonable when people were getting married in their late teens or early twenties. Now, with the average age of marriage closer to 30, many people will have had other significant relationships before they meet the person they marry. We have a longer period of time to work on and learn about ourselves before we settle down, and for many people this includes dating and sexual exploration. Personally, I'm averaging less than one new sexual partner per year since I started having sex, but my number is higher than 5. Yeah, if I got to go back as the person I am today, I would make some different decisions. But I've learned from them and I have no regrets. And I feel you dude, I don't like to think about the women my partner has been with either. But they brought him to me. In the end, unless they contracted an incurable STD or you believe sex is morally wrong, the people our partners slept with before they met us don't really matter. What matters is the person we are with now.",220,"I think what you have identified is simply that there are socially sanctioned relationship preferences, and socially unsanctioned preferences, depending on context.

"I just watched *The Imitation Game* (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it ... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was pretty annoyed to discover that [aspects of the film's plot were warped for the purpose of making it more dramatic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game#Accuracy). I do not think any good comes of this, and to be honest it makes me quite mad. For example, in the film, the main character Alan Turing is portrayed by the actor as obviously autistic to some extent, but according to a quote on Wikipedia (not sure exactly who said it) ""the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film ... bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing"". This, I think, is insulting to Turing's memory, to customise his personality as to make the film more interesting or to make the audience more sympathetic towards his character.

Sometimes it's less minor than character modification. I distinctly remember watching *13 Days* (2000) in a high school history class to supplement our Cold War study. This film ramped up the 'Soviets are evil and JFK is a god' theme to the point of including an entirely fictional battle scene, but went out of its way to present itself as a historically accurate film, including real Cold War footage throughout. We watched it in history class for god's sake! It's also been criticised for attributing a major role in the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis to Kenneth O'Donnell - somebody who was *actually there* argues that ""For God's sakes, Kenny O'Donnell didn't have any role whatsoever ... that's absurd."" I think overblowing or underplaying real people's roles in history is just insulting, and cannot be justified.

Thus, **I am suggesting that films which are 'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred.**

I will pre-argue some anticipated arguments in advance:

* ""They're claiming to be *based* on a true story, not perfectly historically accurate."" 

Yes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films *appear* as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can). It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun.

* ""The aim of a film is to entertain, it is not meant to be a history lesson.""

But to some extent, they are taken as such all the same. A person who knows *absolutely nothing* about JFK will undoubtedly feel at least somewhat more knowledgable after sitting down and watching *JFK* (1991). And you know what, they *should* feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.

* ""It would be boring if we saw films about the events as they actually happened.""

Suck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary. If you want action, watch Avengers. Don't ever watch *Pearl Harbour* (2001). A quote from Wikipedia regarding that film: 'the producer Jerry Bruckheimer was quoted saying, ""We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson"".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?

Okay, I think I've ranted (more than) enough. I need to stop raging about so many movies (don't even get me started on *Pocahontas* (1995) and *Argo* (2012)) - please CMV!

**EDIT: Great chatting everyone! Bad history will still annoy me forevermore, but nonetheless my view has been Changed! The most convincing arguments for me were that it would be incredibly difficult to draw the line between what is minor enough that the director has artistic license and what isn't, and that ALL secondary sources of history are a matter of perspective and interpretation anyway, as well as many other valuable and insightful arguments. Thanks for playing!**

What constitutes a valid representation? Art that depicts life invariably gets details wrong, compresses the complicated or what isn't as noticeable to the artist.  It will always be a flawed representation because it isn't the event itself.  At its best, the only thing art can hope to do is capture the *spirit* of the thing.

So what does it need to depict and to what degree of accuracy before it is considered valid?  Do you imagine historians could form a consensus on this?  Different historians value different aspects of history and disagree with each other as to what precisely happened at any given time, so I highly doubt it.  They would *all* tell you a given film got things wrong, but they would each care about certain errors more than others; one might dispute the ethnicity of a historical figure as cast, one might complain about anachronistic dialogue, another might object to the favorable/disfavorable view of group X doing thing Y at Z point in history.  All the while, other historians will be saying it's as good as it needs to be to convey the necessary information.

&gt;A person who knows absolutely nothing about JFK will undoubtedly feel at least somewhat more knowledgable after sitting down and watching JFK (1991). And you know what, they should feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.

That could be said about any depiction of history, including primary sources that describe historical events and provide the basis of our understanding of most of history.  Herodotus is referred to as ""The Father of History"" because he was the first in European history to systematically gather evidence and form a historiographic narrative.  He  didn't just make errors, he produced propagandistic falsehoods to make Greeks (especially Athenians) look like the best thing since sliced bread.  The idea that the Persian's brought over a million men to fight the 300 Spartans (and a few thousands allies) at Thermopylae comes from Herodotus.  Some of the inaccuracies you see in ""300"" can be traced back to the first recorded account of the battle itself.

&gt;Suck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary.

*Zeitgeist* claims that it is a documentary, it is full of shit.  Bill Maher's *Religulous* used some of the same evidence to try and argue that Jesus was a myth, he is full of shit. *Triumph of the Will* is, in a sense, a documentary.  *Super Size Me* was a groundbreaking documentary...the results of which nobody has been able to reproduce.

If you want to learn history, you shouldn't be trusting one source that claims to give you the full story; especially one that is deliberately packaged to entertain you.  You should gather as many opinions on the subject as you can through any media you like and figure out what you think happened based on those opinions.  If you're particularly competent and interested, you can try looking at original source material and try to interpret what it means.

He  didn't just make errors, he produced propagandistic falsehoods to make Greeks (especially Athenians) look like the best thing since sliced bread.  The idea that the Persian's brought over a million men to fight the 300 Spartans (and a few thousands allies) at Thermopylae comes from Herodotus.  Some of the inaccuracies you see in ""300"" can be traced back to the first recorded account of the battle itself.

&gt;Suck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary.

*Zeitgeist* claims that it is a documentary, it is full of shit.  Bill Maher's *Religulous* used some of the same evidence to try and argue that Jesus was a myth, he is full of shit. *Triumph of the Will* is, in a sense, a documentary.  *Super Size Me* was a groundbreaking documentary...the results of which nobody has been able to reproduce.

If you want to learn history, you shouldn't be trusting one source that claims to give you the full story; especially one that is deliberately packaged to entertain you.  You should gather as many opinions on the subject as you can through any media you like and figure out what you think happened based on those opinions.  If you're particularly competent and interested, you can try looking at original source material and try to interpret what it means.

What you should *never* do is assume that the movie or documentary you just watched gave you significant historical education.",r2,0.8,0.3,0.7,0.6,0.4,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.0,r2,,
"In New Zealand between the last two elections there was a significant increase in funding pushing for a better voting turnout. For many years now they have made it compulsory to register, however measures such as these seem to be highly ineffective globally at getting an increased turnout in elections, not just NZ. There was less than a 5% increase in voting in the last election despite it being a far more prominent election due to the kim dot com saga. National, our right wing party won so promisingly they were able to not form a coalition with other groups (this is almost unheard of in NZ). Many of my peers did not vote, nor did I as we believed that john key was a poor choice for a leader, but there was a lack of any leader that appealed to this group of 10 of us. We all agreed at the time that if there was a vote that had no significance in the election other than to measure those people who do not believe we have any valid current person running for prime minister we would not only have a higher turnout at the election with little effort, but we'd also have a better idea of what the general perception was on the stability of the political scene. This would help us to build a better political scene long term and involve the voter, ultimately resulting in higher voting turnout at a fraction of the cost or social effort and would result in a better turnout. This would theoretically apply globally too, as in countries such as the US it could be used to show many things, not just the (lack of) confidence in either leader, but also other things. I don't know any hurdles that would stop this from being non viable. Implementation might be a challenge but it could easily be overcome and the benefits would well outweigh the costs and implementation efforts","What does a victory for the ""no confidence"" choice entail?  If none, I think it won't have much effect.

The US state of Nevada has had a choice called [""none of these candidates""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_These_Candidates) since 1975, but it lacks any force, and even if it gets more votes than any other choice, the actual person who got the most votes is elected.

In the last Presidential election, [Nevada had slightly lower than average turnout.](http://www.electproject.org/2012g)","What would the purpose of this vote be? I mean, you can't just elect nobody?

When there is an election, somehow, a decision has to be made. And in a democracy, it is normally the people deciding which one from the list of candidates they want to choose. However, electing nobody is not a choice. Therefore I think adding a ""no confidence"" would only encourage the average voter to distance himself from every candidate and refuse his vote.
If someone is really unhappy about the way politics work, he should be able to participate himself as a politician. (I wrote should, because it is in many cases not very easy to do so)
If many people are unhappy with the voting system, maybe this could be revised in a way which encourages more voters to participate instead of refusing their vote.",222,"What does a victory for the ""no confidence"" choice entail?  If none, I think it won't have much effect.

"I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say ""Forks are a blight upon society"", and someone disagrees with you, if you immediately jump to free speech as defense of your idea, you are basically admitting that you have no worthwhile arguments. Yes, you are allowed to say that, but if you actually had something to back it up, say ""sporks are far more versatile, cutting the required utensil manufacturing by a third, reducing global warming 93%"", you would say that. Free speech does nothing to back up the validity of your claim, as you are free to be wrong.

EDIT: I have been convinced that it can be a way of simply saying you do not wish to argue the point further, that you want to let the argument stand where it does.

And, to clarify, I am not talking about free speech as a legal concept. Having to prove your speech legal says nothing as to its validity. I mean having to fall back on free speech as an argument does nothing to prove you right.

EDIT 2: I now feel that an argument for, or against someone's right to a viewpoint has no bearing on the validity of the viewpoint. But, the person who first feels the need to argue this right, however, likely has no argument.

"First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps:

a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted

And b) Forces redditors to deal with consequences if they are downvoted.

This creates a system, where, if you disagree with someone, you can downvote them. This also means that going against the hivemind will net you downvotes, resulting in people who spout popular opinions being the only ones who can do anything.

Ex: /r/movies does a thread about LOTR. You say you didn't enjoy it. You get downvotes and aren't allowed to speak in /r/movies until you wait ten minutes. ","The flaw in your reasoning, here, is that you seem to assume that the purpose of Reddit is to create an open and equal platform for people to discuss different opinions and points of views. 

This was ***not*** the function that Reddit was built with in mind. You are criticizing a sports car because it sucks on off-road terrain; yes, you technically not wrong in your criticism... but that criticism is still misguided.

So it will be near impossible to ""change your view"" and convince you that the points you raised are not true; instead, the view you need changed is your view of Reddit, itself.

Reddit was not built to be a platform for discussion and debate of differing views. It was built as a platform for users to come to and share and/or find the best content. Who decides what is the best content? The users do. And they decide by upvotes and downvotes.

Really there would be nothing unique about Reddit of or wanted to build a platform that encouraged discussion of different--and often unpopular--points of view and treat then equally.

These platforms already exist, and they are called forums or message boards. There, you have no upvotes or downvotes; if you want to disagree with somebody, you have to do it in a reply. In this setting, all comments--and by extension, all opinions and views--are functionally treated equally. 

So you really need to take another look at Reddit from a much different perspective than you are and understand what the system was built to do. It wasn't built as an alternative message board/forum platform. The discussions that take place here are actually a small subset Reddit's usage. I don't have the hard data to back this up, but I suspect the majority of Redditors only visit the site to find content that they **want to find** and **expect to like**; they don't come here to find opposing views or ideas that challenge their own beliefs. 

This is not an objectively good or bad quality of Reddit, it is simply the nature of the beast. No, Reddit's system does not encourage opposing viewpoints or unpopular opinions to be presented on an equal playing field... but that wasn't what it was intended to do, anyways.

When posting or commenting on Reddit, you do so knowing that you are submitting it for judgement by the masses. This is a risk you take. This may be seen as a potential negative, but it also has beneficial effects by discouraging useless contributions. 

If you see the nature of Reddit being fundamentally flawed, then perhaps you should reflect to determine if Reddit is really the correct platform for the type of discussion/community you want.

But can you really fault Reddit for not doing a creating an environment it didn't **intend** to create? ","You can challenge popular opinion to learn things you might not know since it led you to your question.

Debating for a long enough time can come to a conclusion if you're not too defensive. Since you can't know the truth all by yourself, debating can serve other purposes than just have a winner, it can let all participants learn something they did not know.

"It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified:

* The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for, either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild. If we're using the usual justification of animal rights - they can feel pain/have a life - then letting them lead a safe and happy life in captivity seems to be more moral than the dangers of the wild.

* This is a less quantifiable good, but zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies.

While I guess the best way to C my V would be to provide overwhelming evidence that zoos provide lower quality of life for the animals than life in the wild and that there are more effective means of conserving/promoting endanger species, I'm mostly interested in values/premises I haven't considered. 

Change my view! :)

"Tired of that construction down the road? If annual public service was mandatory, maybe that'd be already done!

"Having played dota for 1 year, and Lol for 6 months before that i have come to the opinion that Dota 2 is a much better game in many facets. Not only is dota 2 completely free to play, the actual gameplay is better, and the graphics are much better.


-The Dota 2 map is larger and has more interesting features for vision and juking.


-Dota 2 has TP scrolls and a courier allowing for more interesting map movement.


-Dota 2 heroes have much more unique and scaled up abillities than LoL Champions.  Think techies vs teemo, and heroes like tinker, meepo, lone druid, invoker, etc.  LoL heroes typically have a couple skillshot nukes and a movement abillity as a rule of thumb.


-Denying, highground miss chance, and pulling/stacking make laning much more interesting in Dota.


-Ancients and Roshan are much more interesting high value targets than Dragon or Baron.


-Towers are much weaker in Dota, and smoke of deceit exists, allowing for much more aggressive gameplay.


-Dota heros are much more turbocharged, any dota hero ported exactly would be the strongest champion in League of Legends.


-Activatable items improve gameplay decisionmaking.  LoL items are boring and mostly just stat based.  Dota items allow for much more customizablility in item build and improvement in game play (blink dagger 18 second cooldown vs. flash 300 second cooldown).


Dota 2 has a higher barrier of entry in a style of game whose focus is improvement, and that might lead people to LoL, but given the massive time investment in either game this is basically irrelevent.

But that's not true in all situations, and my current circle of gaming friends is a perfect example. Not one out or the ten of them us willing to even touch DotA because of its complexity, primarily because they're really not good at video games. 

For people who enjoy difficult games with high skill ceilings, DotA is certainly superior - but your claim is missing that bit of context, because not everyone enjoys difficult games, and not everyone aspires to have a high skill level. 

That last part in particular is a point I'm personally trying to come to grips with, but it's apparently the primary mode my friends have - they just want to play to have fun, not to get good; and at all opportunities they will choose having fun over being good. Thus, league is perfect for them - nanda DotA is nothing short of cancer. 


And yes, I die a little every day due to being surrounded by casuals. ","Ah ha!

The superior game offers more meaningful options to a player at all periods of the game. A false option, a calculation or a forgone outcome are not fun.

DotA2 is a strategic game. Everything you do has weight, but you do not get to do much. For example, hero choice is a big choice, but once made, you do not get to do anything about lane matchup, thats a forgone conclusion of the matchup. Your powercurve has been decided. Fights have long CC, and many targeted abilities: You will get hit with stuff, and the timing of these big things is strategic, but really, there is no choices.

LoL is tactical. Most things you do have little weight but there are many options. Almost any hero is playable into any other hero. Builds allow many different options and power curves. Fights are fluid and skillful with skillshots to dodge and many decisions as to targets and timing of spell use.

I can take your points one by one and show you how this works:

1. The map is larger with less vision to make your choice where to go a more impactful one, but the longer distance means you cannot make destination choices often or you will lose time. LoL's smaller map means your position is more tactical, and allows people to redeploy faster.

2. Courier attacks are highly strategic, but leave players with no choices. LoL's recalls give lots of choices, and while most of them only lead to a small gold advantage gained, good players can abuse recall timing to get significantly more farm.

3. You have bigger skills and more unique heroes, which means choice is strategic, but it also means that what you do in fights has been predetermined and you only have a calculation of who to click on to do. Champions with more closely related skill push both players to try attain their perfect play, while denying the opponent something similar, many more tactical choices.

4. The laning mechanics are literally tacked on because without them it would be dull. Heroes have strategic spell casts with massive mana costs, meaning you can make big decisions very infreqently. Thus, to fill time and stop bored players, denying and miss had to be added. LoL lets you cast often, and while each cast is less impactful, it leads to many tactical choices in lane, with spell harass and use being the main point.

5. Roshan is definately a boring objective, granting nothing more than gold and a extra life. Anchient camps are even worse, they only give gold. Dragon gives a stacking buff which forces people to consider the value of each dragon in the context of the unlocked lategame buff. Baron gives a buff which basically makes it impossible to defend against sieges by empowering minions, much more interesting.

6. While DotA heroes are very strong, they are very perscriptive in how they have to be played, offering few choices to the player and even fewer in a matchup. By having more similar champions, interactions are more even and offer many more choices.

7. Active items are simply one extra calculation: ""When is it best for me to use this"" with there being a single best time. Cooldowns are not long enough to make this a unclear decision, and so, in both games, they simply form another button to press.

DotA2 is a harder game, because you must have massive strategic knowledge to play it at any level. You must know matchups, power curves etc etc due to the few choices you can make having high impact. LoL is a easier to start game, as you have many choices to make, which do not have individual large impact. The tactical nature limits the required information starting out, allowing people to  grasp it easily.

DotA2 is not a bad game, rather it is simply a complex game with many mechanics which require a deep knowledge and for this reason it can be said to limit the choices a player can make and this is something a lot of people dislike, leading to the playerbase discrepancy.

LoL is simply superior, more people play it, and the game actively encourages making meaningful choices, the crucial fun in a game.",227,"As someone with 3k+ games of League under his belt and three years of DotA Allstars experience, I think you can pretty easily narrow down your argument to ""complex games are better"". 

But that's not true in all situations, and my current circle of gaming friends is a perfect example. Not one out or the ten of them us willing to even touch DotA because of its complexity, primarily because they're really not good at video games. 

For people who enjoy difficult games with high skill ceilings, DotA is certainly superior - but your claim is missing that bit of context, because not everyone enjoys difficult games, and not everyone aspires to have a high skill level. 

That last part in particular is a point I'm personally trying to come to grips with, but it's apparently the primary mode my friends have - they just want to play to have fun, not to get good; and at all opportunities they will choose having fun over being good. Thus, league is perfect for them - nanda DotA is nothing short of cancer. 


And yes, I die a little every day due to being surrounded by casuals. ","Ah ha!

The superior game offers more meaningful options to a player at all periods of the game. A false option, a calculation or a forgone outcome are not fun.

DotA2 is a strategic game. Everything you do has weight, but you do not get to do much. For example, hero choice is a big choice, but once made, you do not get to do anything about lane matchup, thats a forgone conclusion of the matchup. Your powercurve has been decided. Fights have long CC, and many targeted abilities: You will get hit with stuff, and the timing of these big things is strategic, but really, there is no choices.

"*I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with $10,000 in credit card debt or someone who inflates their net worth by billions to run a major economy.*

**Donald Trump**: His self-reported net worth, in excess of ""TEN BILLION DOLLARS"", is significantly above third-party estimates as well as above his own figure of ~$7b from several months earlier, which included over $1b of bullshit naming rights. If he can inflate his own balance-sheet, who can trust him with the US' budget??

**Scott Walker**: Has $10,000 in credit card debt while posturing as a fiscal conservative. I do not want someone as President who will continue borrowing, and his personal borrowing habit bodes ill for our country's future (not to mention that he has nearly bankrupted Wisconsin). Also, I could not trust him with any executive power as he could use it to wipe out his personal CC and student-loan debt.

I think I disagree because I don't think that this aspect alone could trump (no pun intended, honestly) any amount of good a President could do. Eliminating a President because of one flaw, no matter how severe, can be bad.

For instance, if you had 10 candidates that exaggerate their finances while you have 1 candidate who doesn't, but has policies that would essentially end the world due to their nuke trigger-happy beliefs, I definitely would not vote the last one for fear of Cold War: The Sequel (This time, it's personal).

I definitely would never vote Trump and Scott Walker either, but not for those reasons alone. Had they had incredible policies that would improve this nation better than the other candidates, I would have chosen them as the President despite this one aspect. There's a potential they may damage the economy somewhat, yes, but if their policies can make up for that, I'd choose them.

Donald Trump: A cursory Google search actually puts him at being worth 4 billion. So you do have a point of him.

"First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea.
However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from people's discomfort with their own nonconformity and outlying ideas more than from a thirst for truth.

Additional info: I am currently writing an essay on the phenomenon of 'groupthink' so the theme is ripe in my mind.
I showed this sub to a friend of mine who immediately believes the moral statuses quo of Tumblr, including contradicting ideas, and has always seemed to me to have difficulty breaking social norms and thinking for herself. Her immediate reaction was to dismiss all posts she saw as 'stupid' (that'd be the first page of 'hot' at time of posting). This, no doubt, has influenced my view.

I'd like to highlight again that I am excited to have found this sub and I'll be visiting here often. But I'd like to discuss this idea first.

P.S. I'm so meta I post requests for people to change my view about /r/changemyview on /r/changemyview as a critique of /r/changemyview.

The idea of the sub is not to force people to conform, but rather to provide people with legitimate evidence and logical reasoning that they might not be privy to. 

Additionally, when group think is applied in a logical and critical manner, there is nothing wrong with it. Consider this, if people constantly argue and debate things and *only* change their opinions when presented with solid (logical) reasoning, reasoning which they view as better than their own, the final conclusions reached by the majority of individuals will be the conclusions with the greatest basis in logic and fact.

As I'm sure you are aware simply from spending time on the internet, people are much less afraid to attack positions aggressively and to present some of their ideals which may normally be less socially acceptable.

I think it is fairly reasonable to conclude from all of this that so long as trolling, fallacies and unproductive behaviors (essentially things against the rules) are: recognized, moderated and, when necessary, ignored or removed, CMV is an excellent avenue for one with an open, yet critical mind to learn a great deal.

"A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of $500 on fireworks.  I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but after a few minutes, what else is there but more of the same?

I got good and buzzed, and gave myself time to sober up, and still it went on and on and on.  No pace, no art, just whistle, bang, pretty lights.  And I drove home, and saw dozens of similar displays, all the same.  

These people are just enjoying the bang and zoom and pretty lights, they are not commemorating anything.  And I've seen all kinds of stories, people injured, even killed, by these things, which in my opinion offer little or no excitement or entertainment.

"My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in the wild is ""xe/xer/xerself"" or ""zi/zis/zimself"". My argument is as follows:

1. Pronouns are always dealing with a spectrum. A ""he"" can be used to describe both masculine as well as feminine men and similarly for she and women. The singular they is also covering a spectrum, the spectrum of all people that do not identify with either gender or those that identify with both to differing degrees. Therefore they is sufficient to describe alternative gender identities.
2. If we'd decide that new pronouns are necessary to describe or be inclusive to specific non-standard gender identities, we would very likely end up with a sheer infinite amount of pronouns. Since the argument for further pronouns would not be based on scientific facts but rather on feelings of individual people, the argument why some new pronouns are okay and others aren't would be a very difficult one to make. The result would be that we would have to allow anyone to pick or create their own pronouns.
3. Since we'd have a large number of new pronouns people would very likely get confused, since they'd not only have to remember a name and a face but also the specific pronouns of a person AND incorporate those into everyday speech. The result would either be that people would start inadvertently giving offence or our speech patterns would change to rely far more on using names instead of pronouns. 
4. Having a wide range of new pronouns would actively harm the English language by making it less clear. Encountering unknown pronouns would confuse people and make it difficult to imagine what kind of character is being talked about.

"Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I either a) I don't know b) I don't like or c) I'm not friends with.

Except I'm getting a lot of crap because my friends in relationships (I'm single) want to bring their partners who all fall into one of the three above categories. Why should I host people that I don't want to, and who, chances are, don't want to be there anyway?

"From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin).  It's not like the guy didn't have good qualities or do good things while in office, but for a country that's trying to go in the direction of racial/ethnic inclusiveness, it's pretty baffling that the guy who's responsible for the trail of tears is on our currency.

That being said, I thought it was interesting to see in the news that people are trying to change who is on the $20 bill; however, Harriet Tubman seems like an odd choice considering the other possible candidates.  Off the top of my head, I think Teddy Roosevelt and MLK are the most deserving, and if I had to choose between them it would be MLK.  

Obviously, MLK's legacy speaks for itself, being the leader of the civil rights movement.  Compared to Tubman I just feel like MLK's impact was far greater.  His speeches and non-violent protests impacted the entire nation, millions of people, while Tubman saved ~70 people from slavery.  That's not to discredit Tubman because what she did was brave and important, and her accomplishments weren't limited to the underground railroad, but I think it's fair to say that MLK had a greater impact than Tubman, and therefore is more deserving to be placed on the $20 bill.  I might even go as far to say that it's not even close.

"I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a 'joke' as angry liberals make it seem.

What I'm trying to say, is that people should not be forced into believing and supporting gay marriage, gay/lesbian/transgender/pansexual and all that—they should be allowed to express their freedom of religion without the oppression of liberalism the way they expect not to be oppressed by conservatism. Seems very hypocritical, no?

The point here, is that staunch liberals have a very high tendency to be hypocritical towards religion, but get really offended when a conservative does the same towards them.

It all makes no sense to me, and I want to be open to changing my belief about this one way or the other. It's a big mess that aggravates me, because no one on the far sides of the spectrum sticks to their word very well. I'm a libertarian, so I have my likes and dislikes toward each side, and I would like to understand these specific viewpoints better.

EDIT: This blew up a lot more than I thought it would, which is good. I got a lot of clarification, and I've awarded some &amp;#8710;'s. To be more specific (if you're trying to step in my shoes), I USED to be a devout Catholic, until I thought some of the teachings were immoral and 'behind the times.' I just don't think that religion is a bunch of crap as some make it out to seem; however, since my view has been changed, I believe that as people should have freedom of religion, that freedom of religion can only go so far before it becomes a legal issue. I believe that freedom of religion already has a more bigoted starting point than the opposite viewpoint which is more 'realistic' shall I say.","&gt;What I'm trying to say, is that people should not be forced into believing and supporting gay marriage, gay/lesbian/transgender/pansexual and all that—they should be allowed to express their freedom of religion...

People are already free to practice their religion, they don't have to support LGBT people and they're not being forced to either. What they can't do, is impose their religious beliefs on other people, they can't get their religious beliefs enshrined into law. Religious people are in no way being oppressed by two gay people getting married, they just aren't allowed to dictate the rules on who gets to get married based on their religion.

","Ok freedom of religion does not entail a number of things, first and foremost, you are free to practice your religion and others are free to criticize you or yes make fun of you for it (which makes them assholes, yes, but they are free to do so, just as you are free to mock non-religious people)

2. If you can't distill your point into a few well chosen sentences you probably don't have enough mastery over the subject to convince anyone.

"While I believe this is primarily an American viewpoint due to the US media's tendency to demonize the ""communist"" country, it quite often extends to Australians (mining and immigration) to Europeans. The US especially seems to have the need to pit their country against someone else, and with Russia no longer the biggest threat, they've turned to China. People have blindly bought into it, using China as scapegoat for numerous problems: 

* Pollution
* The economy
* Human rights
* Environment
* Overpopulation
* Food safety
* College admission (too many Chinese students)
* Instability in the South Pacific

Now, I'm not saying there are not problems in these areas, because there are, but I think it's wrong to chastise one group, often to the point of outright racism, when so many of the problems exist in west, and often to a greater degree. 

For example, on the issue of pollution:

People see these pictures of the pollution and don't realize, or don't care, that the reason for it is two-fold. First being that companies from their country have off-shored not only jobs, but pollution, and it's their consumptive lifestyle that is partially to blame. Second, the sheer population destiny (humans are bad with big numbers). For instance, Guangdong, which has at times been called the factory of the world is a province less than half the size of California, yet has a population equal to that of 30% of the US. That's like taking every person from Texas to the west coast and putting them in California south of Fresno. 

Other issues such as over-fishing, which Japan is far more guilty of, and not to mention that a lot of the Chinese seafood is exported to the west. The US gets a staggering percentage of its food from SE Asia. 

On all the issues above there are so many valid counterpoints, or simply a blind eye being turned towards ones own culpability and hypocrisy.

"EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: 

&gt;I think one of the larger roadblocks I'm running into in is distinguishing between identity, behavior, and biology. Because of how closely linked they are I was willing to concede non-heterosexuality encompassing orientations pretty much from the beginning. However I'm also stubbornly holding on to the idea that historically, heterosexual behaviors have been encouraged and any orientation that would facilitate them would be selected for. From there, I concluded that heterosexuality and bisexuality would be the two most likely sexualities to be propagated (by some abstracted gene selection process) but didn't understand why the more restrictive option would be selected for over the less restrictive one.

The answer seems to be hiding in probabilities so if anyone can expand on that more I'm willing to give deltas. 

Also, if you have a problem with my reasoning, please leave an explanation with your downvote so I can understand why it's off. 

---

I struggle to believe that most human beings are naturally supposed to only be attracted to the opposite sex and are inherently repulsed by same sex characteristics. I think most people identify as straight out of convenience and having never needed to question what was assumed for them. I’m not denying that heterosexuality is a legitimate orientation but I have not found convincing evidence against, for example, the possibility that most humans could be predisposed to bisexuality and simply develop a preference of one or none from there. 

The only arguments I’ve read for heterosexuality being default is the biological urge to have children, which I believe is neither universal nor exclusive to heterosexuality and the (imo fallacious) “most people are straight so there ***must*** be a biological mechanism that supports this phenomenon” path of reasoning. 

I'm willing to give a delta to any argument that can demonstrate why heterosexuality might be more advantageous  or likely than bisexuality.

This is in great contrast to the more fundamental principle of the selfish gene as outlined by Richard Dawkins.  You are not what natural selection cares about: only genes are.  If a gene is reproduced, it is successful, regardless of whether or not individual carriers of the gene reproduce.

This explains why homosexuality is prevalent in animals.  Sure, a homosexual organism may not *personally* reproduce, but genes which contribute to that behavior may be distributed in a great many other organisms.  Most likely, those closely related to the homosexual one.  This means that a combination of genes which produce homosexual organisms with a reasonable frequency give us a collection of related organisms, in which some do not personally reproduce.  This is theorized to result in additional caretakers, improving the survivability of that *cluster* of organisms which mostly carry the genes responsible.

So natural selection can absolutely favor ""gay genes""--you just won't find a stable population in which *all* organisms are gay (for obvious reasons).  But it seems that, for many social species, having these genes in the pool is better than not having them.  I.e., they are not actually selected against.

But you may have noticed a key point here.  Although genes which contribute to homosexuality (in combination, or with certain environmental factors, etc.) may be well distributed throughout the population, the system appears to work best when the number of dedicated homosexual organisms is a minor fraction.  To phrase it in inexact terms, about ""one per family"".

As a result, the most stable and successful population has homosexuality in the minority.  It is very important to understand that this does not make it bad, and in fact this appears to be better for survival of the collective gene pool than having no homosexuality.  So it's not weird, it's not ""selected against"", it's not an aberration, but it *is* a minority expression.  That's its optimum distribution.

I would shy away from using the word ""normal"", which has a lot of connotative baggage, and go with the word ""typical"".  Heterosexuality in humans is typical, homosexuality considerably less so, and both contribute to our collective survival.  As we run up to a lot of population walls, and the population plateaus, the equation will change.  At that point (and perhaps we're already getting there), the optimum distribution of homosexuality may be higher.

Aside from all that, there's the matter of bisexuality.  Genetics and behavior are very complex, but when you consider the idea that there are various contributing genes which affect us in different circumstances to, in general, provide a baseline level of homosexuality in the population, it's understandable that many other people may *partially* express that orientation.  Certain aspects of homosexuality can coexist with heterosexual behavior, and so we have bisexuality.  Nevertheless, it seems that statistically the heterosexual behavior must be more common in the population for optimum performance.  So despite bisexual tendencies, heterosexuality is still typical, and more often expressed in individuals with some bisexual behavior than homosexuality is.

You could argue that someone who's even a *little* bit bisexual no longer counts as ""straight"", but if pretty much their entire history of relationships and actual sexual activity is straight, and they just happen to enjoy gay porn sometimes, I think it's reasonable to call them functionally straight.  If we divide bisexuality into ""mostly straight"" and ""mostly gay"", you'll see that straight+mostly straight is much more common than gay+mostly gay.

And beyond all that, you propose that ""most humans could be predisposed to bisexuality and simply develop a preference of one or none from there.""  Well, sure, but you have to realize that we're dealing with a gradient and not three distinct buckets.  We don't start in one bucket and then choose another later.  We have a complex and sprawling map of behaviors.  Our genetics contribute to which paths we take.  It appears that the most typical situation is that people stick to heterosexuality in most circumstances, even if certain circumstances would result in homo/bisexual behavior.  So straight is still typical, despite our potential gradient of behavior.","I think your title is a bit confusing. What you are asking it seems is if there's a genetic determination for heterosexuality. 

One way to answer this question is to look at twins, because they have the same genome, but can have different environment if they are raised separately, they allow to distinguish between genetic and environmental effects with a bit of math. It seems people found a bit of genetic determination for sexual preference.

Another way it just to sequence the genome of a large number of people, and to ask them their sexual preference. If you have enough of these, and with a bit a of math, you can measure how much genetic factors determine a trait. It seems people have found genetic determinants of sexual preference, although the studies are still quite preliminary.

You can also look across different species, for example the genetic of sexual behavior of fruit flies is well understood. There's also some genes in mice that seems to control sexual preference.

Finally one can look across societies, both contemporary and in the past. If something, like sexual preference is conserved across all societies, it's a argument for a genetic basis of sexual preference, because it rules out other environmental factors. I'm not sure about the answer here, but it seems to me that most societies are mainly heterosexual.

Note that everything that touch reproduction is usually under strong selective pressure, because it affects fitness much more directly than other traits.

"First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and I can admit when I am wrong.

I do not buy into the whole argument of 'just because our parents brought us into the world, we owe them our lives.' Whether a child was brought into the world by choice or not, I don't think that being born should impose a debt of respect on the child. 

Furthermore, I think that this respect needs to be earned. I define respect in this context as 'regard for another person's rational ability, trusting that they can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out.'

This is why I think that giving the reason 'because I said so' is a total cop out. If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect. 

Don't get me wrong, I think it is crucial for a child to be told when they are wrong so that they don't grow up into narcissistic asshats. However, I think that they deserve a logical conversation with a parent until one side admits, of his own accord, that he is in the wrong.

If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect.

I think you will find that as a parent, this would be an impossible situation. You say that ""respect needs to be earned"", but isn't this a two way street? Maybe you think the parent who says ""because I said so"" hasn't done enough to earn the child's respect. But has the child done anything to earn respect either? If the parent tried to rationally explain why they're right to the child, how confident are you that the child will understand and ""can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out"". If they can't, then a rational two-way discussion just isn't going to happen.

And if such a discussion can't happen yet, what now? Should the parent and child just ""agree to disagree""? Of course not. I wouldn't frame it as some kind of ""debt"" that arises out of giving birth, but I think its pretty widely acknowledged that parents are responsible for their child's behavior, even before the child is wise enough to understand complicated reasoning. As a third part, I *expect* other parents to keep their children in line, even if their children aren't smart enough to understand why certain behavioral expectations exist.

And similar phenomena happen for all positions of authority. If a police officer is directing traffic, he doesn't have to explain to you the details of what's going on. You have to listen to him anyway. ""Because I said so"" would be a perfectly reasonable thing for him to say when him explaining what's going on in more detail would hold up traffic (especially if you then decide for whatever reason that you disagree). Similarly, there are many employer-employee relationships where ""because I said so"" should be good enough for you. One hopes that there is a good reason behind the requests, but the employee is in no way entitled to a full breakdown of exactly why everything works the way it does, especially when time is of the essence. Its embedded into the nature of these relationships that you follow orders.","In principle, I agree with you that parents do not simply deserve unconditional respect just by virtue of being their parents. But there are several aspects that I'd like to comment on.

First of all, your parents changed your diapers and by the time you're even just 5, they've invested a whole lot of time and money in you. That is enough to deserve some respect and gratitude. That doesn't mean they can't lose it because they do crappy things, but it is worth quite a bit in itself, and it does deserve respect.

In the case of arguments, there's two points that I think are important. First of all, you'll have found that there are many situations in life where ""because I said so"" is something you'll have to submit to if you want to achieve certain goals. Ever had a job? Ever had a boss who told you what to do? Did they always talk you through the reasons for the required actions step by step? It would be nice if they did, because even in a job I'd quite like to know why I'm doing what I'm doing, but they're not required to because they give you money.

If your parents say you can't wear a cap at the table because they said so, then that's fair enough. They're feeding you. You're free to get up and move out and buy your own food, but as long as they're providing for you, they can make rules, even if the rules are stupid and arbitrary and you don't agree with them. I personally don't think that's a very good attitude and I hope I won't be that kind of parent, but I can't really argue with it.

Also, I've had similar conversations with parents because, as I said, I do in principle agree with you, and I'd very much like to be a parent who explains things to their children and encourages them not to take things for granted or as given without questioning them. But I've been told that this just gets tedious sometimes. Maybe you spend 15 hours a day actively dealing with your child. Children ask all the questions and want to do all the things, and if you at some point run out of patience and don't want to explain something for the nth time, I think saying ""because I said so"" is still not ideal, but perfectly understandable. 

With your last statement, I'm not sure which age you have in mind. But people of any age really sometimes suck at logic, and children even more so, so there are arguments that can't be solved this way because no side will admit out of their own accord that they're wrong.

"I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my friends or the people who have gone through that with family or people in general.


As I was walking with my date (M) through town, a group of college students started laughing at us for holding hands. As we were walking by, I kept thinking of all the ways I could get them to stop because if they were to laugh at us, who else are they gonna make feel humiliated or disgusting. I felt like a pet. Some play toy. And that my life was humorous to other people.


I can't say that there would be anything to say or do to make them realize that it's normal to appeal to the same sex. I'm ALL FOR education. I believe education makes the world go around and it's so perfect to learn abd understand new things about the world AND be open minded to everything. 


However, when I see a group of people act ignorantly, I can't help but clench my fist and think about raising hell in their life. The people they are are the kind that take pleasure in hurting people. Why? Because they want to do it for themselves. They can only think about themselves and that they're more perfect than everyone else.


I sure as hell am not perfect. I resort to violence when it comes down to this topic. But when I hear or see ignorance made to hurt others, like this (https://youtu.be/1df_i26wh-w). I can't help but feel like this ignorance needs to be dealt with a punch in the face. Nobody deserves what I got. And nobody deserves the ignorance others recieve.


Ignorance stems from close mindedness, which is something in this world we don't need. If we were all close minded, we wouldn't have advanced as far as we have. Do we really need more of it in this world? Is it necessary for our survival? I believe so to the extent that when there is an absolutely close minded person,there is an equally absolutely open minded person (the bell curve).


So to deal with these people is to punish them with hurt nowhere near the pain they've inflicted onto people, while still sending a message. CMV


Edit: I know violence won't get me anywhere. Are there any other solutions besides time, education and ignorng other people that can remedy the situation more directly?","Lets start with ignorance, because I believe you're not representing it properly, and aren't fully thinking through the implications of what your suggesting.

Ignorance does not stem from closed mindedness, but rather, lack of knowledge. You, and every other human on earth are ignorant about many things in the world.

"Country music was not always bad. There were legends such as Johnny Cash who defined what country music was. 

However, today the country music culture is full of songs about booze, trucks, tractors, and women. Almost every song sounds exactly the same, following the same chord structure, tone, and melodies. There is no creativity when it comes to country music and it has not had a positive influence on the music industry. Although there may be a few exceptions to this, the majority of modern country is awful, redundant, and lacks any sort of meaning.

"I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God.  The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me.

***The social issues I'm talking about are:***

* ***LGBT issues*** such as same sex marriage, religious freedom laws, ""bathroom bills"" involving trans people, etc.

* Their black and white stance on ***abortion***- some of them want no exceptions for cases of terrible fetal deformities, threats to the life of the mother (Scott Walker in the last debate), rape, incest, etc.

* Fighting against ***contraceptives*** and the morning after pill that could prevent unwanted pregnancies and prevent abortions

* Pushing ***abstinence only sex ed.*** [37 states allow for medically inaccurate information to be taught to students as ""fact"", so long as it scares them out of having sex. My school was one of the ones that taught blatantly incorrect information.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/08/sex-education-requirement-maps_n_5111835.html)

* ***Marijuana legalization***

* Being so ***bible/religion*** based when the population seems to be shifting away from religion

***Please please please change my view! I live in Ohio, so I really can't let myself slide into apathy thinking that the GOP has no hope of winning anything!

Edit 1: Wow! Lots of responses- awesome! It's going to take me a few minutes to sift through all this. :D

Edit 2: Delta awarded- if a candidate like Hillary gets the democratic nomination and young people who are frustrated with government express that frustration by just staying home on election day, it will definitely give Republicans an advantage, no matter their stance on the issues.

Edit 3: Please cite sources if possible. Feelings and anecdotes don't hold the same weight as things like polling data from reputable institutions, academic studies, etc.

Edit 4: Another delta awarded- to /u/WhiskeyCoke77 for a good academic explanation of issue salience, how some voters find some issues more important than others.

"I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my friends or the people who have gone through that with family or people in general.


As I was walking with my date (M) through town, a group of college students started laughing at us for holding hands. As we were walking by, I kept thinking of all the ways I could get them to stop because if they were to laugh at us, who else are they gonna make feel humiliated or disgusting. I felt like a pet. Some play toy. And that my life was humorous to other people.


I can't say that there would be anything to say or do to make them realize that it's normal to appeal to the same sex. I'm ALL FOR education. I believe education makes the world go around and it's so perfect to learn abd understand new things about the world AND be open minded to everything. 


However, when I see a group of people act ignorantly, I can't help but clench my fist and think about raising hell in their life. The people they are are the kind that take pleasure in hurting people. Why? Because they want to do it for themselves. They can only think about themselves and that they're more perfect than everyone else.


I sure as hell am not perfect. I resort to violence when it comes down to this topic. But when I hear or see ignorance made to hurt others, like this (https://youtu.be/1df_i26wh-w). I can't help but feel like this ignorance needs to be dealt with a punch in the face. Nobody deserves what I got. And nobody deserves the ignorance others recieve.


Ignorance stems from close mindedness, which is something in this world we don't need. If we were all close minded, we wouldn't have advanced as far as we have. Do we really need more of it in this world? Is it necessary for our survival? I believe so to the extent that when there is an absolutely close minded person,there is an equally absolutely open minded person (the bell curve).


So to deal with these people is to punish them with hurt nowhere near the pain they've inflicted onto people, while still sending a message. CMV


Edit: I know violence won't get me anywhere. Are there any other solutions besides time, education and ignorng other people that can remedy the situation more directly?","First of all, let me just say that I understand how you feel. I've been in the same situation as you but not for the same reason. 

I'm from the US and during my middle school through early high school years, I went to school abroad in a non-english-speaking country. Ignorant remarks about my mastery of the english language were commonplace, with my peers often telling me to not speak English because I wasn't in the US, speak clearer, speak slower, and to go back to the US if I was going to speak English. Sometimes they would be joking, other times I feel not so much. 

Violence would not have solved anything. It's not like once I would've hit them they would have gone ""Wow, I guess this guy's right. He's changed my view entirely with a punch to my face"". No. They would have resented me, associated violence with being able to speak English correctly, and strengthened their opinion as true. 

The fact is, ignorant people react this way to things that seem foreign to them because that's what they've been taught. Their negligent parents never taught them to be tolerant or that people can be with whomever they want. Or those types of reactions are applauded by their ignorant circle of friends. Or, in your case, they grasp at the opportunity to make sure their friends don't think they're gay too (though most of the time the people that make the most commotion out of it are usually the ones that are hiding something). 

Ultimately, violence does not deter this kind of behavior. In the short run, yes: you can raise hell and they'll go away. But the next day they'll find someone that can't defend his or herself physically against these bullies and the ignorance continues. 

The only thing in the world that solves ignorance is education. Not violence. And we're getting there. 

Think of it this way: homosexuality has been seen as bad for hundreds (if not thousands) of years, and the western world has undergone the transition from ""gays = weird, disease-ridden, etc."" (ignorant, inaccurate descriptions) to just having legalized gay marriage a couple of weeks ago in the US. 

As with most issues of ignorance in society, it takes a while to eradicate it. Blacks and Whites getting along as they do now (for the most part) was inconceivable to Americans of just 100 years ago. Look how far we are now. 

The good news is that we're getting there. ","Violence takes many forms.  It can be physical (punching someone) or it can be more abstract like censorship (imposing will).  Violence is the use of force.  

Endorsing violence to change close minded people is pretty circular.  One who uses violence as a tool to impose will is being just as close minded.  What you're really saying is ""they will never agree with my correct view, therefore I need to force them to change for the betterment of all."" There's a utility to that but I personally believe it's dangerous.

Advocating discourse and advocating for violence are polar opposites.

"Greetings!

I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay.

However, as far as my understanding of History goes, Humanity kept uniting into bigger and bigger groups.

I'm not sure whether my order is correct, but it's merely to give an example of what I am seeing.

First, families started working together as it was easier to hunt that way  
Then, they started to form small tribal communities  
Then, these tribal communities united into alliances and ""great tribes""  
Then, the tribes became petty kingdoms  
Then, the petty kingdoms were either swallowed by a larger one, or swallowed the smaller ones.  
Then, the kingdoms they formed kept absorbing the smaller communities that were similar in culture

And then there are countries like the United States and Russia, both spanning almost entire continents or more. Likewise, they have the strongest presence as well. The United Kingdom had an equally great presence during its Imperial days, which it more or less managed to retain.

I feel Europe could easily raise its economy to the third power if each current country paid its tax to a single, central government that viewed each part of the union equally, at most... with different strategies, investiture focuses.

The main counter arguement I see against an united Europe is cultural decay or incompatibility, but I do not understand how it would get in the way too much. Culture won't disappear just because people answer to a single elected government, neither will it disappear due to people wandering within the borders.

You are suggesting that countries opt in.  This method - while more civil and required by our modern day, global society - is unlikely to bear fruit.

&gt;  The main counter arguement I see against an united Europe is cultural decay or incompatibility, but I do not understand how it would get in the way too much. 

**Language**: [Europe has many languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe).  This is an especially large problem when dealing with the law where interpretation of a given case, statement or law is the difference between success and failure.  So if only for the most basic reasons, if you have one country, you need one language to be the primary one.  Which one would it be?  

**Social programs**: Any standard that any country currently set for their social programs is a carefully calibrated balance between what they're willing to spend and who they will spend it on. This means that once the countries are united, *everyone* needs to eliminate their social programs and start over with a much larger country in mind.  This will be *fantastic* for the poor countries that have little to no social safety net.  But this will mean that the bar will be significantly lowered for more lucrative countries.  

**Political Parties**: Each country has it's own political preference.  But more than that, the political systems are not even set up to mean the same things.

You are suggesting that countries opt in.  This method - while more civil and required by our modern day, global society - is unlikely to bear fruit.

&gt;  The main counter arguement I see against an united Europe is cultural decay or incompatibility, but I do not understand how it would get in the way too much. 

**Language**: [Europe has many languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe).  This is an especially large problem when dealing with the law where interpretation of a given case, statement or law is the difference between success and failure.  So if only for the most basic reasons, if you have one country, you need one language to be the primary one.  Which one would it be?  

**Social programs**: Any standard that any country currently set for their social programs is a carefully calibrated balance between what they're willing to spend and who they will spend it on. This means that once the countries are united, *everyone* needs to eliminate their social programs and start over with a much larger country in mind.  This will be *fantastic* for the poor countries that have little to no social safety net.  But this will mean that the bar will be significantly lowered for more lucrative countries.  

**Political Parties**: Each country has it's own political preference.  But more than that, the political systems are not even set up to mean the same things.  So to me, the French Socialist party might seem a lot like the Swedish Social Democrats, but they might be vastly different.

Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, and though I believe the world is not black and white and there is a grey area in between, what is that grey area? I haven't been able to figure it out like, for example: a man steals food from a shop because he doesn't have enough money and he needs to feed his kids, then he gets caught and taken to prison. Though he did something ""bad"" (stealing) for a ""good"" cause (feed his children), he still did something bad therefore he gets a punishment. Where's the grey in that? I don't know.

That's one of my confusions, the grey between the black and white. To be clear, I'm not bigoted or religious and I understand there are diferent types of good and different types of bad depending on your context, where you live.

The other thing I'm confused about and that is fairly linked to the first one is if there's something besides ""the good"" and ""the bad"". I personaly live by trying to do the good but I also think that the bad is necesary until a certain degree.

"I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any meaning in calling life ""free"" then one should freely be able to leave at their discretion.

Raising the rails could be argued for as a preventative measure for someone throwing someone else off the bridge, but that's not what I'm interested in. Should it be raised as a preventative for suicide.

I don't think suicide is as much of a problem as we think. ""People shouldn't commit suicide"" - this belief stems from Middle Age christian era and seems to have been passed on from generation to generation. I don't have any scientific knowledge, in fact I don't think there can even be any scientific knowledge that can imply a reasoning such as this. It seems to me to be an idea that could be true and also may not be true.

Further, who am I to judge that someone else's life with someone else's perspective that it is always wrong to kill oneself? Surely even with a simple cost-benefit analysis it can sometimes be ok.

I still understand the sadness that arises when someone does it, but it's not because they've done it, it's because of where they must've been to want to do it.

Sure, I'll admit that raising them may prevent a few cases, but someone that is intent on doing will still climb over it. But I don't know for sure that it will, there's no evidence to my knowledge that supports this. Then there's also the side that raising the bars will make the initial altitude higher and increase the acceleration of the falling person increasing the likelihood of death from the impact.

For those who don't want to change my mind, I'm interested in hearing your arguments that support my opinion also.

Thanks!

"I've learned about the concept of the hedonistic treadmill (by myself not by reading the wikipedia page). In short: The more you enjoy something, the more you'll get used to it, and the less you'll enjoy it!

Consequently, in life things like, say, videogames, make you used to high levels of stimulation, making everything else in life seem dull and boring.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, that is except for the fact that videogames are like 99% useless, and consequently you could have similar amounts of fun, on average, after getting used to the usual amounts of stimulation you can find in real life, with the plus that you get a lot more time and energy for things like your education and career, your social and love life, and any hobby or intellectual interest you have!

Even in small amounts videogames drain the fun out of life and take a large amount of time and energy, without giving anything back, at all.

Conclusively, videogames are bad, and society would be better off without them.

* how structure can create freedom
* how to lose
* how to set reasonable expectations
* how to break problems down into small area's and find small things to improve that will have large scale effects.
* It definitely improved my under pressure decision making

* how to analyze my surroundings and improve my ability to problem solve under pressure or external forces
* how to use failure to learn and develop required skills
* the importance of being prepared
* greatly improved my navigation skills

"I know this is a very controversial subject, and many people disagree with me, and I have to admit, I am not the perfect judge for this.

A little background on me, just because you should know. First, I consider myself conservative/republican and I am also under 18, so I can't vote. I also live in the US but I think this applies to most countries.

So, I don't think everyone should be given the right to vote. The average person I have found does not know about economics, politics, and policies to make an educated vote.

I see people all the time saying stupid stuff on facebook about something about politics and they really don't know what they are talking about.

In school, you may take one or two economic classes, but that is definitely not enough to make enough of an educated vote. I don't know, because I don't know what I don't know but I feel that the economy is much more complicated than what could be covered in that time.

Something that bothers me a lot is when people make opinions over something they are not educated about. I think we should let the experts make decisions, because they are smarter and more knowledgeable in that subject than the average person. So people, not knowing what the experts say, will go in and vote over something they don't know hardly anything about. Unless you know virtually all the facts about something, you are not educated enough to make decisions about it if there are people do know all of it.

And frankly, you average Joe did not go to school for years and years to study political policies and their effectiveness. Yet he has a vote on what is going on, and that really bothers me. And honestly, I am in that same bout. Maybe it changes when I can vote, but it does not seem like that when I look at older people I know.

Is part of my argument possibly flawed because right now we have a democratic government, and I am republican? Maybe. But I think I can recognize the same problem even if I had the ""upper hand"". I know reddit is generally very democratic, so please don't make this about that.

I would honestly would like someone to change my view.

Edit: fixed to under 18.

Also, /u/drjonesenberg added something that really helped change my view. Delta to him.

My primary reason for believing that Bernie Sanders is *at least* as electable in the general as Hillary Clinton (I actually think he's *more* electable, but that's immaterial to this CMV) is a set of thought experiments, which simply revolve around considering the behavior of individuals/groups voting (or abstaining) in 2008/2012, how that behavior would respond to Hillary being the nominee, and how that response would be *altered* by having Bernie as the nominee instead. For ease of illustration, I'm going to use Jeb Bush as the stand-in/proxy for the eventual Republican presidential nominee - if you think the GOP will likely nominate someone else, and it will make a difference in how a significant number of people vote (or abstain), feel free to specify why/how in your reply, and then proceed within the context of your chosen Republican presidential nominee.

-----

So, here are some examples of the general form of the thought experiment - this set of examples is, by no means, comprehensive, but I've yet to think of one which significantly advantages Hillary over Bernie:

 * Describe to me the person or demographic, who voted for Obama in 2012, who would vote for Hillary over Jeb in 2016, but who would vote for Jeb over Bernie in 2016. (Impacts: Swing votes)
 
  * Now describe to me the opposite group (Bernie&gt;Jeb&gt;Hillary) - which group seems larger?

 * Describe to me the apathetic Democrat who, once they are familiar with Bernie as a candidate, is more energized by Hillary than Bernie. (Impacts: Democrat turnout, i.e. harmful abstentions)
 
  * Now describe to me the opposite group - which seems larger?

 * Describe to me the Republican who would make it to the polls to vote against Bernie, but would be like ""meh, fuck it"" and not bother to vote against Hillary. (Impacts: Republican turnout, i.e. helpful abstentions)

-----

Now, outside of that form of argument, one thing I've seen cited as evidence against Bernie in this respect is a particular Gallup poll, regarding attitudes towards those who identify as socialist:

&gt;For years, Gallup's been asking the following question: ""If your party nominated a generally well-qualified person for president who happened to be X, would you vote for that person?"" 

&gt;In the most recent iteration of that (from June 2-7), [respondents were least likely to say yes when ""X"" was ""socialist""](http://www.gallup.com/poll/183713/socialist-presidential-candidates-least-appealing.aspx) at 47%. More respondents said they'd vote for an atheist (58%) or a Muslim (60%).

My problem with that is as follows:

Every one of those descriptors, except for socialist, is a largely apolitical identity - whereas being ""a socialist"" is a political ideology.

The phrase ""just happened to be [black/Muslim/Jewish/a woman]"" implies that the nominee would have said identity, but would still mostly follow the tenets of whatever ""your party"" was - whereas ""just happened to be [a socialist]"" implies an ideological leaning that potentially conflicts with whatever you feel ""your party"" stands for.

Therefore, comparing the numbers for ""a socialist"" to all those other identity-based descriptors, without also including numbers for ""a conservative"" and ""a liberal"" simply doesn't provide a useful context in which to interpret the numbers for ""a socialist"".

I also think that, due to the way the question is asked, the poll winds up *seriously* underestimating the impact of *strategic voting* (i.e. voting for the candidate with the best chance of beating your least preferred candidate) against the GOP - I think it's just plain ludicrous to suggest that 41% of Democrats would prefer Jeb Bush to Bernie Sanders, simply because of the socialist label, but maybe I'm wrong on that point?

-----

Another argument is that the GOP media machine will be able to use the socialist label to get their base frothing at the mouth and drive turnout (this relates to the 3rd example thought experiment).

My feeling here is that, considering that has been Fox news' sole purpose for the last 8 years, they are already well beyond the point of diminishing returns - there is no part of the base, who is amenable to this sort of strategy, who isn't *already* frothing at the mouth, socialist or no - trying to use the socialist label to wring *even more* turnout from their base, at this point, is trying to squeeze blood from a stone.

-----

Finally, while the GOP's fear/anger-based strategy for motivating turnout is a finely-tuned machine at this point, turnout among Democrats is much more variable - so many on the left feel entirely apathetic towards the party, so turnout is unreliable.

I will admit, I don't even know exactly why, but Hillary seems to *personify* what people on the left are apathetic towards - nobody, *nobody* I've talked to, on Reddit or IRL, seems excited about Hillary. On the other hand, among those who have become familiar with Bernie as a candidate, he seems to energize people in a way that I've simply seen no recent evidence of *any* other potential candidate even coming close to.

Since voter-apathy seems to be a fairly huge problem on the left (relative to the right, at least) this seems like a *huge* point in Bernie's favor - especially because it could also have a fairly significant impact on Congressional races.

-----

One last thing: I know the socialist label is a big part of this discussion, but I don't want it to devolve into an **exclusive** focus on that - I am interested in how Bernie stacks up *against Hillary*, so if you are going to talk about how people respond to the socialist label, please keep it in the context of a comparison with how people respond to Hillary as a political fixture.","Black voters were key to Obama's election and strongly support Clinton as well.

"First, I know ""egalitarian"" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word ""feminism"" has, but I feel like it's time for a change. 

The internet has caused a lot of voices that may otherwise be drowned out come to the forefront, such as the feminist extremists (or ""feminazis"" if you will). It seems that because of this many people are being turned off by the idea of feminism (myself included) because they associate that word with the people that blame all of life's problems on the patriarchy. 

My friends are starting to joke about feminism and I see more people mocking it every day. I believe it is due to the extremists, and how polarizing and antagonistic a lot of their views are. This stubbornness to stick to the name is causing a lot of people to dismiss, or even despise, the movement and is hurting it's support. I feel that if true feminists were willing to distance themselves from the ""feminazis"" it would stop a lot of animosity people have towards them. 

This might end up being as simple as calling it something different, because maybe the only ones that would keep the term ""feminism"" would be the extremists. They might want to retain the name so as to not give in or lose the fight. Of course there is no way of telling, and they may very well go along with the ""true feminists"" and call themselves egalitarian anyways. 

In either case, I feel like it would be beneficial to cause a clear divide between feminists and feminazis in order to garner more support and to have feminist ideas to be taken more seriously.

Change my view guys!","Others have already said a lot about this, so I'll leave you with [this](http://mikerugnetta.tumblr.com/post/123744373585/op-onions-pretty-disappointed-with-idea-channel), a really, really good post on why ""egalitarianism"" has come to be at odds with feminism and why feminism embodies the ideals of egalitarianism way, way better than egalitarianism does.

It's also worth pointing out that the ""feminazis"" (god, I hate that term) often have something resembling a point. I'm no fan of the Gawker-network callout culture that's become somewhat of a normalized force in internet discussions today, but I think that most of the internet's disdain of feminism comes from a caricatural portrayal brought about by cherry-picking examples of poorly-manifested attempts at feminism. I think it's valuable, next time you see a ""feminazi"" post, to look carefully at the source material and realize that, however acerbic or acidic the post might be, the author's coming from a legitimate place of pain much of the time, a place which unfortunately informs the tone of the piece.

Feminism as a movement is great. It tackles head-on many uncomfortable questions about inequality between genders that are reinforced thanks to vicious cycles and socialization, and if people who are benefiting from that inequality (myself included) are angry that people are calling them to think more critically about the advantages they've been handed, then so be it. I think there are some people who get turned off by the overwhelming minority of people who embody the movement poorly, but I think that more people get turned off by other men who already have a disdain for the movement - a disdain that will not be changed easily, especially by re-terming the movement.

I think that, in the end, there's a quote I'll paraphrase that I can't remember off the top of my head that describes the need for the term to stick around: in any article discussing feminism, the vitriol of the comments section validates the movement's need to exist. It's got power under its current name, even if many people wouldn't like to admit it, and as long as it continues to gather steam there's no reason to change it to another name dominated, as the Rugnetta post shows, by straight white men.","I think we just need to make the feminist organizations that are more egalitarian prominent.

"I'm seeing posts everywhere regarding the ""safe space"" that reddit is destined to become under the new CEO's leadership, but have not been able to find any agenda from Pao herself that seems controversial at all: the only thing I've seen her say is that she's concerned about harassment and threats, and I would argue that both of those issues are not only deserving of attention, but not at all shocking. I've also seen people say that subreddits critical of Pao have been removed, but there are always other factors at play in the comments and there are several still going, plus about five front page posts per day about what a horrible person she is, so I don't know if I can call that censorship either.
In short, I feel that the predictions about reddit becoming an environment that bans free speech or whatever are wildly overblown. Ignoring her personal life (which, scandal ridden or not is irrelevant to her performance at reddit) can you change my view?

Here I also might need to concede that even if subs devoted to harrassment *were* banned (CoonTown, fatpeoplehate, etc etc ad infinitum), I don't think reddit or the world would be losing anything of value. I'm embarrassed to tell people I come here because of those subs, and I don't think that reddit or any privately held corporation is under obligation to host anything of that nature. So while I don't see them getting removed, I wouldn't she a single tear if they did. This is of course a different debate, but one that likely plays a role in my view here.

Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways of communication could hardly be any more different from ours. A dog leaping onto you is not expressing affection; it's literally asserting dominance. A dog dragging you by the leash is not eager to play; it's showing you who the top dog is and ordering you to follow the pack leader (itself). A dog making eye contact is, again, asserting dominance--read: not affectionately gazing into its master's eyes. The list goes on. Seems like we've anthropomorphizing our cuddly partners a bit too much. Chances are, it's probably not thinking what most people think it's thinking. A dog that looks ""depressed"" to most of us is really just an obedient dog with a responsible owner. Man's best friend? That's some grade-a bull. Man's best friend is none other than fellow man. Dogs have no capacity for logic / reasoning skills and will bark at any stranger to feel better about themselves. We don't understand them very well, and they understand us even less. They've helped our hunter-gatherer ancestors, and are still useful to people with certain disabilities today. But that makes them no more than co-workers and can hardly be considered potential friends, given our inherent differences in nature. Dog experts of reddit, I'd love to have my mind changed on this one because I literally can't look at dogs anymore without thinking they are incredibly savage and overly-hierarchical creatures undeserving of our attention.

What about when your dog lies down next to you as you are sleeping and growls at other people when they get too close? What about when you are wrestling with a buddy and your dog thinks you are getting attacked and tries to save you?

I agree that dogs don't really have the mental capacity to understand the complexities of friendship in a tit for tat type of way and their inner pack mentality will be a factor in how they operate but I don't think that make it impossible to have genuine feelings for their human companions.",r2,0.7,0.3,0.8,0.6,0.5,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.8,0.3,0.0,0.7,0.5,0.7,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.8,0.8,0.5,r2,,
"I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my friends or the people who have gone through that with family or people in general.


As I was walking with my date (M) through town, a group of college students started laughing at us for holding hands. As we were walking by, I kept thinking of all the ways I could get them to stop because if they were to laugh at us, who else are they gonna make feel humiliated or disgusting. I felt like a pet. Some play toy. And that my life was humorous to other people.


I can't say that there would be anything to say or do to make them realize that it's normal to appeal to the same sex. I'm ALL FOR education. I believe education makes the world go around and it's so perfect to learn abd understand new things about the world AND be open minded to everything. 


However, when I see a group of people act ignorantly, I can't help but clench my fist and think about raising hell in their life. The people they are are the kind that take pleasure in hurting people. Why? Because they want to do it for themselves. They can only think about themselves and that they're more perfect than everyone else.


I sure as hell am not perfect. I resort to violence when it comes down to this topic. But when I hear or see ignorance made to hurt others, like this (https://youtu.be/1df_i26wh-w). I can't help but feel like this ignorance needs to be dealt with a punch in the face. Nobody deserves what I got. And nobody deserves the ignorance others recieve.


Ignorance stems from close mindedness, which is something in this world we don't need. If we were all close minded, we wouldn't have advanced as far as we have. Do we really need more of it in this world? Is it necessary for our survival? I believe so to the extent that when there is an absolutely close minded person,there is an equally absolutely open minded person (the bell curve).


So to deal with these people is to punish them with hurt nowhere near the pain they've inflicted onto people, while still sending a message. CMV


Edit: I know violence won't get me anywhere. Are there any other solutions besides time, education and ignorng other people that can remedy the situation more directly?","Warning, anecdotal story ahead:

While it's easy to assume that violence is the easiest answer to a conflict like this, I have a recent personal example (where violence was encouraged) that worked out better bonviolently. 

A fried I'd made at school thought I stole weed from his house. He'd recently discovered the online drug market and was experimenting with all kinds of drugs. He was doing everything from ketamine, to LSD, to opiates. You get the idea. 

So what'd happened was that he couldn't find his stuff as soon as I'd left. The next time I went over, they were having a party. As soon as I'd walked in, this guy (high on percs) starts yelling ""that's the fucker who stole my dabs"" 

I'd heard that he thought that from someone, but I thought it'd be ridiculous for him to accuse me because he should know I'd never do something like that. I found out at that moment that he really thought I'd steal from him. He got up, got in my face, and started screaming at me calling me a theif, a liar, all while there's a good 20 people around staring. 

I stayed calm the entire time. I knew I could resort to violence, but I'd always been taught nonviolence will get you farther. 

I removed myself from the situation, calmly told him I'm sorry that he thinks I'd do something like that, but that I'd leave. 

Banned from the house, I found out later that he'd found what he thought I stole waaay under a couch. When we head back to school in August he wants to talk and apologize to me for everything and clear the air. 

Now I could've punched him in the face one of the multiple times he tried to get physical. I could've screamed back. I could've called him a drug addicted fuck, beat the shit out of him, and still be seen in the right. 

Because I resorted to not using violence, and gave it time rather than resorting to getting physical, I may have one less burnt bridge. 

Whether or not he's a friend worth aging is another topic, but I feel this story sets up a good example for why nonviolence is a more desirable route. 


","But what happens when you lose your majority?

"I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununpentium) or [ununtrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununtrium), I got the feeling that it's almost cheating to call these things elements and add them to the periodic table.

The atoms are created in a lab, usually by slamming two other heavy atoms together in a collider. The resulting atom decays in microseconds and does not naturally occur outside the lab.

Calling these things new elements strikes me as the same thing as grabbing two random objects, (say a water bottle and a book), holding them together in your hands and saying, ""Look! I've created a bookbottle!""

The object will only last until you let go of it, and then be torn apart by the stronger force, in this case, gravity. It's not a new tool or object and you can't file a patent for it.

Ununpentium and its ilk are not elements if they can't be found outside the lab, cannot exist as more than a few atoms at a time, or last more than a few microseconds. They are interesting experiments to be sure, but they are not new elements.

Change my view.


EDIT:

Wow, I really didn't see how many gaping holes my argument had. 

What I've learned:

&gt;Short half life

It's short by our human standards, but that means nothing on the universal scale. Our lives are nothing on the scale of the universe, that doesn't mean we aren't alive.

&gt;Very few atoms at a time

This is just a limit on what we're able to synthesize. Massive quantities could theoretically be created in a supernova.

&gt;Not outside the lab.

Where it is synthesized doesn't matter. The lab is still in the universe, so it could be said that the universe is creating these atoms.

There are lots of convincing arguments here, and I'll respond to all of them and delta the ones I feel really swayed me. Thank you for the discussion.","&gt; Calling these things new elements strikes me as the same thing as grabbing two random objects, (say a water bottle and a book), holding them together in your hands and saying, ""Look!

This is a bad comparison. In your example two things are simply held next to each other and called a new thing. For man-made elements it's not like (for example) a gold and a plutonium nuclei are simply held near each other for some period of time. There is actual scientific evidence that an entirely new nucleus and thus an entirely new chemical substance, was created. A gold and a plutonium next to each other behave like a gold and plutonium, but if you smash them together (a nuclear reaction) and make a new nucleus they behave *completely* differently in a fundamental way. 

&gt;can't be found outside the lab

Why does it matter where an element is in our universe? It's still what it is.

Why does the size of the totally new thing matter?

Many elements and objects have known half lives. Others have proposed half lives. Even protons may decay after ~10^32 years. Why should the timescale be important just because it is relatively ""short"" for a human?

"I believe that ""Buckle up, it's the law"" is a very bad slogan, because it is an [appeal to authority](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority) which can be rejected easily in people's minds if they aren't aware of the purpose of a law.

Instead, an appeal to the motorist's intelligence by pointing out the consequences of not buckling up, and thus making motorists aware of the possible consequences of not buckling up and making it obvious why it is rather sensible to wear one's seat belt would be a lot more effective. 

[This German ad posted along public roads throughout Germany](http://www.dvr.de/bilder2/p3737/3737_0.jpg) is an excellent example of this. The text translates to ""One is distracted, four die"". A brief but concise outline of cause and effect, enough to raise awareness.

"Hello CMV,

I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from your basic youth teams) and never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing it was simple as that. By losing and not being rewarded we understood we had to try harder as an individual and try harder as a team to win. This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team.  I really dont understand the idea of rewarding everyone for not winning, it's almost like saying ""hey, even if you dont try you still win"". I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize. To me that just teaches a kid that NOT giving your best will still result in a prize. What lesson does that teach you when you grow up? That your failure or lack of effort will be rewarded regardless of how you performed? Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up? Personally if I had a kid and he/she played a sport I wouldn't allow the coach or a parent to give them a trophy for simply participating, I would make them understand that a reward/trophy is earned by hard work and dedication. I know not all kids are athletic but I still dont understand the concept or idea. 
We all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? Again, I am not trying to sound cold but I just dont understand the concept of rewarding 
failure/losing, CMV......

Edit: thanks for all the answers, feedback and insight. Many of you helped CMV. Again, I hope I didn't come off as cold or inconsiderate. I have younger cousins and love to see them succeed in anything they do, especially sports. I was more interested in having a discussion as to ""why"" and the mentality behind it. Many of you made valid arguments and gave me some great insight. I'm happy to keep discussing if people are interested but please note I am not against the idea but was more interested in helping me change my view of it. If anything please continue to give your children positive feedback, effective communication, motivation and let them know that team work is a great thing. I recommend everyone put their kids in sports (dont push them into it but help and guide them into something they love doing or are very passionate about). It really does pay off when you get older and helps them build some self confidence and understand the dynamics of a social environment. Thanks again everyone! 

Edit 2: Since the discussion continues, I think children under 12 should only get participation Trophies. Once you hit that age you should be teaching your kids the fundamentals of structured team work, effort and the idea that life will not reward your for simply showing up. Giving participation trophies to kids 13 and above is not a good life lesson. If you care to continue CMV on that! 

Edit 3: Thanks everyone for the continued conversation, input, points of views and personal experiences. This sub is great for people who are curious as to get the other sides opinion and everyone should keep an open mind about changing their view on the matter. Now some last bit of advice for coaches and parents who put their kids in sports. PLEASE keep your eye out for the that one un-athletic kid who might not be the best on the team and make sure that his/her team mates understand this is a team event and that everyone is in this together. Some of these personal experiences shared with me shed some light on how people hated playing sports  and were being bulled because they were that kid and the other kids made them feel left out. Not all kids will be good athletes but you can teach your kids to respect one another, support one another and to ensure that they understand the unity of team work. If your kid is that ""all-star"" on the team then make them understand this most because the other kids will look to him/her to see how they treat the rest of the team. A good leader will understand this and this habit will grow with them, you just have to show them how and why. Thanks again for all the input, this is a great sub.

"This boggles my mind. 

I know that some airlines are different like Southwest because they do not have assigned seats. But why don't people relax until their seating zone/group is called when you have a reserved seat?

It's not like the gate person knows that the boarding tunnel is clear or that the previous zone has almost completed been seated.

It just seems more relaxing for everyone to go in a ""just in time"" fashion versus standing in the tunnel, then standing in the plane and trying not to make the person in front of you who is trying to get into their seat anxious.

It's a small thing, but its madness and because we can only fit one lane of people in at a time it seems really inefficient for so many people to be standing around.

Edit: I absolutely don't mean that I would only get up the moment I gave a completely clear line to my seat. That's ridiculous and I'm not coming from a point of laziness. It just seems there's a lot more efficient things the airlines can do to make the process faster.

Edit 2: (Some reason Now for Reddit didn't succeed in saving this edit) I see that a lot of people have a great need for overhead space that I definitely underestimated. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to give everyone who mentioned this before my edit a ∆ but I sure did try.

Not surprisingly, I posted this just before getting on a plane.","As someone who flies quiet frequently, I used to agree with you, but now I know you are simply wrong.

"I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters.

I am not disputing the fact that the United States achieved its principal military/political goals (defeat of the Third Reich and the Japanese Empire), and I of course recognize the fact that the US managed to do so with virtually no civilian casualties/ destruction of the homeland, which is especially impressive given the sheer scale of civilian destruction seen in World War II.

What I am arguing is that, having 'won' (as much as it is possible to win) the war, the United States promptly lost its soul, and has ended up in a worse position than Germany or Japan. The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.

I think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on. It's a cycle that only leads to cartoonishly large military budgets and American blood spilled in conflicts where we don't belong. In short, hegemony has not been kind to the United States, and we would be better off if we weren't a world power.

Contrast this with the Japanese and Germans, who are (arguably) doing rather well for themselves. Sure, each country was broken and defeated at the end of the war, and it took a very long time for them to recover, but they came out better. I say they came out better because neither the Japanese nor Germany have the 'obligation' to police the world. In fact, both countries forbid themselves from taking offensive military action. While these countries can be (and often are) considered 'western', and are sometimes the target of anti-western hate, they are not widely hated like the United States, and are not tasked with maintaining ridiculous global military presence. Rather (and forgive me for oversimplifying), Germany can focus on Germany and Japan can focus on Japan. One need not look long to find a wealth of statistics to indicate that these two nations have far superior social safety nets, education, healthcare, etc. than the United States. While this superiority can, of course, be attributed to a wide variety of factors, I believe that one cannot ignore the important fact that these nations have their priorities straight, having suffered the shame of defeat, having gone through the experience of rebuilding and being free of any expectation of global military prowess.

What really solidifies this belief for me is the existence of universal health care in most of western Europe. I apologize that I don't have the source, but if I remember correctly, I remember watching an interview with a worker in the UK's NHS, who attributed the success of socialized medicine in Europe (versus the US) to the fact that Europe had to rebuild after World War II. Effectively, when you have to start from scratch and pick your life up from the rubble, there's a greater sense of common bond with the rest of your nation. The US, having not been hurt in the war in the same way, never had to rebuild and instead developed a more violently individualistic character, where the idea of potentially paying for someone else's health care is utterly repulsive. Americans, by virtue of having won World War II without civilian casualty, has ended up with a far worse society than those who 'lost'. If that's the case, aren't we the real losers?

"**tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting?**

I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to sports, I know more and watch more than any of my peers through work, school, or friendship. I like hockey, baseball, and the NFL. But regular season games are boring.

Boring can be good sometimes. A casual baseball game on a lazy afternoon is amazing, and it's great in the background during a family gathering. Seeing a game in person is awesome and regular season games are perfect for that because if you miss a play it's not the end of the world. I find the NFL regular season *almost* engaging because of the short schedule. I understand that in the NHL and MLB you need to play more games so the gap between 1st and last is sufficiently large, so I'm not suggesting shorter schedules. I would just really like someone to make regular season games more exciting for me.

The NHL is my favorite by far, but I can't stand regular season games. Until the very end of the season it just feels like watching practice. There's no excitement. It's like a 10 cent bet. Until the end of the season, very little is on the line. I don't see the appeal.

So can someone explain it to me? When I ask my friends who do watch the regular season they get condescending.","MLB - It's a pass time, baseball is a long, slow grind that builds up gradually and doesn't matter much until the end of the season, this falls into your view of ""not mattering a whole lot""

NHL - Also my favorite sport, and depending on your team there are three categories that they'll fall into: Obviously making it into the playoffs (Chicago, Anaheim, Tampa, Pittsburgh). Obviously *not* making the playoffs (New Jersey, Arizona, Philadelphia, Toronto, whatever the expansion teams will be), and finally bubble teams (Ottowa, Columbus, Minnesota, Edmonton^maybe , Buffalo^maybe^unlikely )

For the ""gonna make it"" teams, there isn't much on the line other than home ice advantage, though that doesn't mean much, so the big thing is seeing the team progress and develop and making sure players are healthy, not terribly compelling.

For the bubble teams, this is where it gets interesting, you're talking about battles *all season long*, the wins *matter* when the team is only 2 points out of the wild card, the last 2 months of the season are frantic, with everyone trying to fight their way into the playoffs, for some people it's as good as playoff hockey from February on.

For the ""obviously not gonna make it"" teams, the regular season matters the *most* to them! It's all they have and if the team realizes it early enough and there's a highly touted prospect on the board next season (like Austin Matthews) it's incredibly important that the team does poorly. I'm a Sabres fan and this last season was one of the most tense and compelling I've watched in years, because they *needed* to finish last.

So in the NHL for the majority of the teams at least half of the regular season is extremely important for either making the playoffs, or getting into last for the best chance at the top draft pick.

NFL - 

I saved this for last because I almost can't believe that you feel the games are important. There are only 16 games each season! Any single game can and does mean the difference between making the playoffs and going home at the end of December. 

Even if a team is bad games have *massive* implications because drafting is so important in the NFL.

Compared to baseball or hockey, each NFL game counts for 10 baseball games, or 5 NHL games, all in one day! You have the majority of the games against teams that are constant rivals, that are battling for just 2 or 3 playoff spots available.

So much in the NFL can swing on one weekend that it's almost *too* important!

TL:DR - I pretty much agree with baseball, but the NHL and especially the NFL every single game matters for most teams.","While the thrill of every game being a ""do or die"" situation isn't always there, I think if you're a true fan of the game, then regular season games are fun for their own reason.  Sure, it's a bit like practice, but you're watching it for the strategy.  You're watching it for the athletic ability.  You're watching it to see how the management is playing the long game (Do they use a pitcher today in the 13th inning, or save him for his start tomorrow?)

Seeing a guy make an amazing play at shortstop, or seeing a guy shoot the puck past 3 defenders from the blue line is just as awesome no matter when you see it.  

Then there's the rivalries.  I'm always going to be happy to watch the Flyers lose, no matter what.

"I always have to hold my eyes to keep them rolling out of my sockets when i hear (australian) people talking about their trips to europe and canada and america.

To me you have to be pretty dull and boring and douchey to want to go overseas and experience a mild variant of your own culture instead of a different one. Its classic tourist behavior but at least retarded resort-bound tourists outside of the west are pushing their comfort zone slightly.

Travel isnt supposed to be a way to get away from your shitty 9 - 5 that you dont have the guts to quit, its supposed to be a journey where you explore other places and other cultures.

If other cultures are so scary to you that youd save up thousands to go to a place where language and climate are the only differences from home youre probably a bit of a douche.","&gt; its supposed to be a journey where you explore other places and other cultures.

Okay, so I'm not going to get into a ""who said?"" version of this debate because that's pointless. I'll accept your premise. 

So what you'd argue is that my trip to Costa Rica is inherently more valuable than my trip to, say Dublin because I live in the United States. Fair enough. 

But here's my counterpoint: I am quasi-humiliated by my trip to Costa Rica because that shit was fucked up. Traveling to non-western (re: poor) countries is an incredibly morally murky process. It doesn't *have* to be but if you don't speak the language (one of your points) you're stuck with using industries that thrive off of Western travelers. And those industries can have a devastating effect on those areas. 

Now,we all can get behind the idea that going to Thailand to engage in sex trade is a pretty reprehensible. That's clear cut. But what about that beach resort in Mexico? Who's running it? Who profits? Whose working at it? Under what condition? What local industries/buildings/landmarks got bulldozed in order to capitalize on the beach front? 

Costa Rica is absolutely beautiful. But the culture is, with few exceptions, to be folksy for tourists. That's what people do. Much like parents who will amputate a limb of a child so they do better begging, this has some pretty serious consequences. No one is building anything. All the major infrastructure (the resorts, the tour packages, the skyride tours) was built by Western cultures. What's left for locals is to essentially pander to the tourists. And they *do*. And it is kind of sad. 

Yes, we spend money. I bought bracelets and sodas and magazines and candy. And that, I am sure, has a positive impact. But the net impact, the larger picture, is that the travel industry is pretty much holding people hostage because the money pouring in pours right back out to the people who invested in the infrastructure and only the dregs trickle down. We visited a very rural school and it was so striking because it was one of the only places we visited where we weren't being pandered to. 

**So here's my point**: Exploring other places and cultures is an inherently imperialist act. For more info, I strongly recommend reading *A Small Place* by Jamaica Kincaid. The idea you're espousing might actually be more imperialist, more harmful. At the end of the day I think there is value in experiencing other cultures and people, but I also know that MY gain comes at a price for their culture. It has to. But we don't talk about that. We focus on the small gains made by locals who profit off the travel money. We don't think about the bigger picture of who profits from travel and what is LOST in creating that infrastructure. Yes, if you go to rural Laos this is less of a problem, but who the fuck wants to vacation there. Even if you DID, how are you going to get around if you don't speak the language or have any help. That's simply not realistic for most people. 

But western tourism (visiting New York for example) doesn't come with the same moral quandaries. We are capitalizing off our own tourism. We're capitalizing off our own tourism in [Thailand](http://www.bangkok.grand.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html) as well, but we do so by swooping in and taking over. 

The whole ""value"" of experiencing other cultures? We're the ones that made that up.  Probably to sell hotel rooms. In Costa Rica.","&gt; If other cultures are so scary to you that youd save up thousands to go to a place where language and climate are the only differences from home youre probably a bit of a douche.

You seem to have a very narrow view of why people travel.  Many visit other countries to visit family, historical / architectural / artistic sites of interest, professionals in the same field etc etc etc.  

You will need to be a bit more specific as to why a person spending their money on a trip to a place that interests them makes that person a douche.

Also as an Australian I see plenty of people spend a couple of weeks on a tour in Thailand or hanging out at a retreat in Nepal (completely failing to immerse themselves in anything resembling the local culture). When these people then claim that they are 'better' than others for travelling somewhere non-Western - now that is being a douche.

Travel isn't *supposed* to be anything other than what you make it.

"To clarify my title I believe that having an abortion is unjustifiable unless the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or child, or the child is the product of rape. I understand that this is a touchy topic so I'm sorry if what I'm saying comes off as offensive. That is not my intention. My main reasoning is basically this.
Human life is incredibly valuable. It is a guarantor of all other forms of rights, or it at least allows for the possibility of other rights. As such the maximization of life should take precedence to other considerations, such as the right to choose whether or not you want to terminate a pregnancy. 80% or more of all pregnancies in the united states will be successful, and pursuing an abortion just decreases the amount of possible lives.

To clarify my point here is a thought experiment. Say you have a 2 year old child and a woman who is pregnant. no one would argue that killing the 2 year old is wrong. No matter how humanely it happens, you are robbing the child of the years of life it could have had. having an abortion in my opinion is just as wrong because the 2 year old and the unborn child have almost the same likelihood to live out a full life and taking that away from either of them would be morally unjustifiable.

Also, the woman giving birth wouldn't have to take care of the child. contrary to popular belief, in recent years the number of children being put up for adoption has [steadily been decreasing,](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/15/us-adoption-domestic-waits-idUSBRE90E15Y20130115) while the time it takes for those who want to adopt a child has steadily been increasing, with some couples waiting up to seven years.

As a note my stance here has nothing to do with any sort of spiritual beliefs. Also I'm left leaning on most issues so it has nothing to do with party alliances. please CMV!

"They've been saying this since the 30s. Keynes predicted that as technology increased and our material needs would be met, we would only need to work 15 hours a week, instead we are working longer hours than ever.

People were saying from the 18th Century that the industrial revolution will make man redundant? But did it? People moved on, new types of job openings which we'd never have imagined before came to be, think about the luddites' opposition to technology. We do not have anything to fear.
","This is kind of an aside: 


I think both sides of this argument are missing the point here (and I do agree with points on both sides). While I do think that it is possible for automation to replace the lion's share of modern jobs (I just watched a lecture yesterday where it was claimed that only ~20% of factory jobs were lost overseas whereas they discovered in retrospect that almost ~80% were lost due to automation), I also think economists opposing this view have a good point when they say that we can create new jobs, ones that we can't even imagine today, to keep the majority of people employed to the same degree as today.


That said, I think there are two *very important* factors missing from this discussion: 


1) The inherent value of a newly created jobs compared to past jobs, and

2) Our economic system's ability to accommodate accelerating technological change in terms of employment


Regarding the first point, people tend to become disillusioned about work on a psychological level when they feel that their work isn't adding any value. That was one of Marx's core critiques about Capitalism when he argued how essential it was for the workers to control the means of production. The less valuable/necessary people percieve their jobs, regardless of how well compensated they are for it, the less satisfied they will be with their lives. I recently read an article about how the vast majority of people in cities like London, a place where many people (office drones) are employed in information industries doing jobs that didn't exist ten to fifteen years ago, feel that their jobs are utterly meaningless in the grand scheme of things (and they're not wrong) and many subsequently feel depressed.


London is an extreme example but rest assured, with increasing automation, most other places will start to catch up. Information and information-based services will be (already is) the most important product that we produce, not physical goods/labour. This means is that the work we do as humans is becoming more work for the sake of work. A century ago, the majority of work that we did were things that quite obviously needed to be done. We repaired things, we built things, we provided crucial services, and so on. Think about ten people around you today and ask yourself: do the jobs they do create a net benefit for their lives and the lives of people around them, or are their jobs essentially bullshit?


You'd be surprised at how many jobs today add little to no value. Even if they do add some value, it's often not (nearly) enough to rationalize it taking up 40+ hours of someone's life each week. This trend is only going to get worse, too, as more and more ""critical"" jobs are automated/rendered obsolete and more and more bullshit jobs get added to the pool. It's no wonder that people are miserable: we've seen a kind of spiritual decay where the vast majority of people have become miserable in their employment and that it's only going to get worse until we decide enough is enough and no longer require people to work in order to provide for themselves. This is all exacerbated by the fact that we're collectively more educated and aware than we've ever been, and that we all know the most surefire way to become wealthy is to game the system (like on Wall Street), not create value for others.


As per the second point, say you disagree with my first point and want to argue that the value of new jobs being added to the economy is worthwhile enough to continue to employ the majority of people in new jobs. Fair enough. The other problem with this is that a lot of the jobs being added don't fit into the employment model of the past century. It's becoming harder and harder for companies to justify hiring people full time, putting them all in an office and making them sit in cubicles for 40+ hours per week. Just look at the business models of Uber, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram and so on: these companies are indicative of a 21st century employment model. They are not traditional vertically integrated companies that need to hire tens of thousands of people in order to function, instead they get by on hiring a handful of people and providing a service to more than a billion people. Traditional vertically integrated companies are learning from this as well and reducing the number of employees they have (when they can get away with it). 


Thanks to the internet and accelerating technological change, these 21st century business models are scalable in a way that traditional business models weren't. A lot of the information-based services and distribution models around them that needed to exist last century are totally irrelevant now and are in the middle of a mass extinction. That's why we've been hearing the death rattle from the MPAA and many other large ""information brokers"": they're irrelevant and they're flailing wildly trying to find a way to prop up the old business model just so they can survive (while making everyone hate them in the process). We don't need a middle man anymore, the software is the middle man with algorithms replacing humans as gatekeepers to 1s and 0s. 


So regardless of what you think about automation and job creation, you can't dodge the fact that our current employment models no longer make sense. The world is full of offices that exist for the sake of tradition (and supposed information security) where the majority of people sit at their desks doing valueless busy work and surfing the internet every chance they get. That's why we're seeing a huge boom in freelancing. A (regulated) Uber-style employment is likely going to be the new employment model for the next few decades. Companies are going to want to hire freelancers (from anywhere in the world), have them sign NDAs, produce X amount of work for them and those freelancers might do work for 2-3 companies at the same time.


Blue collar work is no exception. Companies like McDonalds are slowly and carefully revealing to the world that they intend to phase out many of their workers in the coming years, something I expect will be accelerated by minimum wage increases. Retailers, large and small, are beginning to becoming nothing more than glorified show rooms and many are losing the battle against online shopping. Jobs in the transportation industry (taxis, trucking etc) see the writing on the wall. ""Sharing economy"" services like AirBnB and Uber will continue to have an impact. Services like Instagram and smartphone cameras killed vertically integrated behemoths like Kodak. The list goes on.


Anyway, even if you think that automation is going to displace rather than replace people, I think you still need to concede that replacement is possible if we allow it, and that there are good arguments for replacement over creating jobs for the sake of creating jobs. First and foremost, unless we do something radical (like basic income) a lot of people (especially those not educated or business/tech savvy) are going to fall in the cracks opened up by accelerating change (like anyone who works in the transportation industry today). 

I also think there is another, even better argument for allowing ourselves to drop out of the labour market if we want to, and that argument is an environmental one: we overproduce and overconsume more than any other point in history, it is unsustainable and that we need to start producing and consuming less and therefore we need to start thinking up a new way to organize economic activity around the concept of sustainability.

**Late edit**: added tl;dr

**Tl;dr** 

- Basic human needs are finite and can be totally satisfied with automation in the foreseeable future
- Current levels of automation have already displaced humans away from work that has obvious value
- New jobs have increasingly less value than before when they are created in spaces where they can't be automated (yet) and thus job satisfaction is on the decline
- Many new jobs are created for the sake of creating jobs (a symptom of past bureaucracies / legislation / remaining inertia from 20th century employment practices)
- We increasingly overproduce and over consume because of our economic model and increased efficiency over time
- The employment system is shifting from full time to part time freelancing type employment, which can be inhumane without the proper framework in place (basic income) 
- We need to change our antiquated view of work where we think every able bodied person should work to one where we see work as optional and less centralized 
- We need to think of a new economic system or else things will start getting ugly and this is true regardless of whether you think future automation will displace or replace humans","I'm getting a PhD in this now.  Over the next 20 years things will get crazy.  To look over the horizon, there's a few technologies that are just now coming together.

 * Cheap Sensors: 6 years ago I wanted to make an RC Segway.  I started on it, but you either had to hand build a sensor from cheaper ones or buy one pre-made for $600.  Now, those sensors are $2 a piece and come in cell phones.

 * Computing Power: For things like automatic cars you need a lot of fast processing power because you can't wait 5 seconds to figure out if you're about to crash.  Right now, things are just getting to the level where a $500 or so computer can do enough calculations to have something workable.

I think both sides of this argument are missing the point here (and I do agree with points on both sides). While I do think that it is possible for automation to replace the lion's share of modern jobs (I just watched a lecture yesterday where it was claimed that only ~20% of factory jobs were lost overseas whereas they discovered in retrospect that almost ~80% were lost due to automation), I also think economists opposing this view have a good point when they say that we can create new jobs, ones that we can't even imagine today, to keep the majority of people employed to the same degree as today.


That said, I think there are two *very important* factors missing from this discussion: 


1) The inherent value of a newly created jobs compared to past jobs, and

2) Our economic system's ability to accommodate accelerating technological change in terms of employment


Regarding the first point, people tend to become disillusioned about work on a psychological level when they feel that their work isn't adding any value.

I don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. 

Suppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a ""creep"" for ""looking through"" her profile. 

I'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have ""good old days"".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as ""creeping someone's profile"" online. Putting aside when a ""profile"" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. 

So the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...

I feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them.

Firstly, a 15% flat tax would be a significant decrease in tax revenues, so that's unrealistically low.

The issue with taxes is what activity are the people you're taxing giving up to pay for the taxes. The more someone earns, the more likely that paying taxes is only cutting into luxury expenses. Currently, the bottom 20% of earners pay a total tax rate of about 8%, so you're essentially doubling the taxes on poor people. This is taking money out of budgets for food, housing, and basic expenses. When you're making $20k per year, losing another 8% of your income to taxes is devastating. If you're making $500k per year, a tax cut means you maybe take extra nice vacations or buy the biggest Mercedes instead of the 2nd biggest. Additionally, spending on basic stuff is most beneficial to the economy. Tax cuts for lower income people generate more economic activity than tax cuts for wealthy people. Any time you're generating economic growth, you're also growing future tax revenues, so cutting taxes for poor people ultimately allows you to lower the overall tax burden.

&gt;It seems to me that it is punishing somebody for making more money, making it more desirable to stay in the middle class instead of encouraging people to work their way up into a higher class.

There is no point in our tax system where making more money results in you taking less home. The top marginal rate is less than 40%.

And salaries are certainly not proportional to effort or hard work or whatever virtuous qualities one might invoke to say that the higher income folks ""deserved"" it.

Firstly, a 15% flat tax would be a significant decrease in tax revenues, so that's unrealistically low.

The issue with taxes is what activity are the people you're taxing giving up to pay for the taxes. The more someone earns, the more likely that paying taxes is only cutting into luxury expenses. Currently, the bottom 20% of earners pay a total tax rate of about 8%, so you're essentially doubling the taxes on poor people. This is taking money out of budgets for food, housing, and basic expenses. When you're making $20k per year, losing another 8% of your income to taxes is devastating. If you're making $500k per year, a tax cut means you maybe take extra nice vacations or buy the biggest Mercedes instead of the 2nd biggest.

"Whenever I book air travel, I always sit in a window seat, and I contend that the window seat is the far superior seat in almost every way. 

1) The views are amazing. The majority of people even 50 years ago had not had the ability to travel by air due to its high cost, and therefore lacked the ability to see the amazing views afforded by sitting at the window of a jet airplane. In my travels, I've been able to look down at the glaciers and coasts of Greenland, see the Grand Canyon from the air, look down on Niagara Falls, appreciate the rolling green hills of New Zealand, and behold the grandeur of the Rocky Mountains. And this is all in less than a decade of regular air travel, and I'm not even counting the fact that just about EVERY view from the air is amazing, even if it's just the cornfields of Nebraska. The longer I keep flying, the more amazing perspective about the beauty and scale of our planet I will be able to appreciate.

2) A place to rest your head to nap. When you have an overnight flight, or a really early flight, and you just need to catch some extra ZZZs on the plane, the window seat is the best place to be because you can ball up your jacket and use it as a pillow against the wall.

3) Elbow and foot protection. The few times I've been unfortunate enough to sit in the aisle seat, I almost always get bumped on my elbow or foot by the drink cart coming down the aisle. It's just such a narrow aisle, and the cart takes up the entire width, that it's bound to hit you at some point, especially if your shoulders are a little wider, or if you're engrossed in a book or headphones and can't hear them asking everyone to move. In the window seat, this is never a problem and you don't risk getting bumped. 

4) Control of the window shade. Sometimes it does get really bright outside, and in that case, the person in the window seat has complete control over how high or low to keep the shade. You get to set it at the level that's comfortable for YOU. 

5) Not having to get up to let others in during boarding. When I get on the plane, I like to sit down and use those few minutes to answer some emails or text messages, or (admittedly) scroll through Reddit's front page a bit. When sitting in a window seat, once you're seated, you're done. You can sit there uninterrupted for the whole duration of boarding. If you're seated in the aisle or middle, you run the risk of being interrupted and having to stand up, clog the crowded aisle, and losing time to do the things you were doing while waiting for boarding.

Now I'll admit there are a couple problems with the window seat:

1) No easy access to lavatory. You have to ask two other people to get up when you need to use the bathroom. However, I think that with some good advance planning, one can use the bathroom in the terminal and not have to use it at all on a shorter flight. For longer flights, is it really that bad to have to ask someone to get up for a minute to let you out? They know you'll need to go at some point, so as long as it isn't every 20 minutes, I think it's totally fine. And if it really bothers you to inconvenience strangers, you can wait until the middle seat person needs to use the lavatory, and then just go at that point when the aisle person is already getting up. 

2) Can't stand up when the plane parks to get your luggage first and/or stretch your legs. But this doesn't seem like such a problem. I mean, you've just been seated for a number of hours on the flight...what's 10 more minutes? Just wait patiently for the aisle to clear, then grab your bag.

In summary: I believe the window seat is clearly the superior choice when flying. It's not perfect, but on balance, it affords the most interesting scenery, the most comfort, and the most convenience. 

The reason I'd be interested to have my view changed is for those times when I may be stuck in an aisle seat for reasons outside my control, and I'd like to know the reasons why it's not so bad to have to sit on the aisle and not feel like my entire flying experience is ruined by not getting the window seat. 

I think we can all agree that sitting in the middle seat is an unsatisfying and degrading experience in every possible way.

1. The window seat gets really cold. I dislike the cold and it gets uncomfortably so, especially in the colder parts of the year. You need some layers to fly from Fargo to Chicago in the window seat.

2. The view thing is kind of nullified at night, most of my flights have been at night and though it's cool for flying over cities, most of the time you can't really see anything. 

3. If you're near the engines you have to deal with more noise/vibration if you're in the window seat as opposed to if you were in the aisle. ","I've been flying a lot lately, and whenever I have the chance, I take the aisle seat. 

1. This is a bit overrated, it's nice to see the windows for awhile, but after a few flights it loses it's novelty and is just annoying. Not to mention if you get it over the wing, it'll ruin your view.

2. This is a good point, but I will argue, that basically getting up during a long flight is much more worthwhile. Doing flights over the Atlantic always made it so much nicer to be able to stand-up and walk around a bit, maybe stand for a few moments. If I'm stuck in the window seat I have to bother other passengers to let me out, and this becomes a bit of a pain, especially if they're sleeping. I don't like inconveniencing other people, and the aisle seat gives you much more freedom in that regard. You will never sleep more than maybe an hour or two, and even that if you're lucky. 

3. I've never experienced that, but I'll concede this point. 

4. Usually, since the aisle seat is removed from the shade, you're not effected by it at all. 

5. There is an even better solution for this one. Instead of waiting in the seat and rushing onto the plane, and potentially inconveniencing a person seating on the isle seat, this basically allows you to do all that browsing/email checking, but in the comfort of the airplane lobby. While everyone is getting boarded, you're free to wait around until the queue to get on the plane is almost completely empty. You don't need to rush on your plane at all, and once you reach your seat, you just have to sit down. Aisle seat allows you the luxury to take your time, not inconvenience anyone, including yourself and actually get more effective time in the lobby instead of on the plane. There's absolutely not a single good reason to board early and be in front of the line. 

One point that you have missed is luggage access, if you realized mid-flight you have something in your on-board luggage you'd like to access, it's much easier to do so from the aisle seat. 

Another is, that if you're in the emergency exit row (the one with the extra leg room) the aisle seat absolves you of some moral responsibility when it comes to crashing.

"There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud ""woo-ing"" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. *Edit: He may have another disability as well, it was difficult to tell. Deafness was the only apparent one.* Much of the audience was clearly uncomfortable, but didn't want to ask his guardians or someone from the theater to get him to leave. I was having quite the moral dilemma about it, I didn't ask either, so I'm not saying that anyone was in the wrong about staying quiet.

Perhaps he shouldn't have been at the movie to begin with because of the graphic nature of the film, but that wouldn't have been enough to ask him to leave. 

So, change my view. Even though this child had a clear disability and the disability is why he was being a disturbance, it should be okay for him to be kicked out without repercussion.

~~What a weird conclusion.~~

Without all of the strikethroughs/edits: ""his guardians/parents should have quieted him or had him leave. If I had spoken to an usher, then the usher could have asked his guardians to be quiet. Maybe it would be okay for him to be removed still, I'm struggling with this part still. I shouldn't approach the guardians. Otherwise I would expect to get a refund and go see the movie another time.

#Current struggle points:

* Is his time &amp; enjoyment more valuable than the rest of the moviegoer's combined?
* What are arguments against him going to a time dedicated to children/families, a time with significantly less viewers, or some other method of viewing that wouldn't have caused a disturbance to others? 

#Irrelevant at this point:

* I know I can ask the manager for a refund and/or leave. That doesn't address my view, or change it.

#Update:

At this point, I will only respond to those I feel like are making a good case or I want more information from. I highly encourage continued posting, I am reading absolutely everything and genuinely interested in what people are saying.

"I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small town/village, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too many to list, but the big ones are:

#Cities have significantly better municipal services.

The difference is night and day. Cities have bigger and better libraries, schools, police/fire departments, hospitals, gas, internet, and so on and so forth. As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first. Everything about this makes city life so much safer and more comfortable.

#Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.

A really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops. Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties. There are theatres and large public events and strip clubs and meetings of like-minded people and clubs and just about anything to do if you ever get bored. There's a convenience store on just about every corner.

#Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity.

If you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a **new neighbor** that they wanna get to know and everything. Even if you abstain from social interaction, you become ""that weird neighbor that abstains from social interaction."" This  tends to temper individualism, and it's not like you can ""just spend time with the people you like,"" because rumors and all travel fast with a community that small.

#bugs

holy fucking shit the bugs aaaaaaaaa

#In the country, everything is high maintenance.

Since just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.","&gt;there is a greater range of things to do

I would greatly dispute this.  Few cities have any decent opportunities for hiking, kayaking, sailing, hunting, trapping, fishing, birding, shooting, or a great deal of other activities.  When I find myself in a city for whatever reasons, I find myself quickly getting bored due to the lack of interesting things to do.

&gt;There are theatres

Small towns have those too.

&gt;large public events

This is a negative to me.  I can only think of one large public event that I enjoy, and it involves camping.

&gt;strip clubs

Don't need or want them.

&gt;meetings of like-minded people and clubs

These are pretty easy to find out in the country.

&gt;just about anything to do if you ever get bored

Like I stated before, cities have a severe lack of most of the sorts of things I like doing.

&gt;Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity

This can also effectively be achieved by having a mile or so in between your house and your neighbour's.  You never have to see another human if you don't want to.  Cities are just so crowded and there are people everywhere.  In a city, I feel like I can't snese without accidentally invading someone's space, and I certainly have no hope of having no one invade mine.  In the right place country, I could set off a bomb and no one would give a shit.

&gt;bugs

&gt;holy fucking shit the bugs

This is actually a major plus to me.  In the city, I'm lucky to see a single Black Saddlebags, but in the country I can see a wide range of different insects.  As someone with a fascination for entomology, this is a fantastic experience to me.  The only bugs I don't like are things like gnats and mosquitoes, but you get those in cities just as much as you do in the country.  Maybe even more so, depending on the place.

&gt;In the country, everything is high maintenance.

&gt;Since just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.

Sounds like you are making stuff up.  I have not experienced any appliances having significantly shorter lives in the country.  It is pretty easy to keep things clean even living far from other people.  Living in the country is not the same as camping.

Overall, I can't imagine ever being able to live in a city.  Most cities I measure how long I can stand to be in them in hours (the best cities rate days).  A few cities I would only be able to stand a few minutes and at least one I found so terrible that I refuse to ever go there again.

Edit:  I forgot to point out the most important one: ""Everything is closer in the city"".  I love having space and having things further apart means more space.  Having things closer together is a big negative to me and is the main reason that I would not be able to ever stand living in the city.","&gt;I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone.

Honestly, this just shows a lack of maturity and a fundamental lack of knowledge about the human condition. 

&gt;Cities have bigger and better libraries

OK... but I don't need a big library. I just need a kiosk that is part of the intra-library loan program. When I want to read a book, I do it from home.

&gt;schools

This is rather obviously not the case. Public schools in major cities are cesspools, and achieve worse results with more funding than suburban or rural schools. 

&gt;police/fire departments

I don't know of any way to measure this, other than to say that my sheriff's office has cleared 100% of the homicides in my county in the last 10 years... how's your city doing in that regard?

&gt;hospitals

Sure

&gt;gas

I've got some bad news for you, there, bucko. Gas, both of the gasoline and natural varieties, is cheaper in the country.

&gt;just about anything to do if you ever get bored

I've lived in the country for more than 15 years now, and I can't say that I've ever been bored. I'd guess that one big difference between myself and a denzien of, say, NYC, is that the activities I choose to entertain myself mainly occur outside.

&gt;There's a convenience store on just about every corner.

It saddens me that you view this as a good thing. I personally find this worse than the previous comment about strip clubs. 

&gt;If you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares.

Well, the co-op board sure does. And the nosy neighbors that I am now forced to share a wall with do. 

&gt;If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a new neighbor that they wanna get to know and everything.

Heaven forbid that people want to be friendly, as opposed to smacking the ceiling with a broom handle and telling you to turn down your music. 

&gt;Even if you abstain from social interaction, you become ""that weird neighbor that abstains from social interaction."" 

As opposed to the weirdo in 4C that has his groceries delivered and hasn't left his apartment in 2 years? And have you walked by there lately? The SMELL!

&gt;This tends to temper individualism, and it's not like you can ""just spend time with the people you like,"" because rumors and all travel fast with a community that small.

I'll take spiders in the garden over bedbugs and roaches any day of the week, thanks. 

&gt;Since just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.

Honestly, this is some bullshit. I'd MUCH rather live in my well-built country home, with it's high end appliances, than I would one of the shithole shoeboxes that city suckers have to contend with. My master suite is bigger than most NYC apartments. 

I'm pretty sure you just made this point up. 

Not to mention, I can pee off my deck without it being illegal. Or have a bonfire to celebrate something. Smoke meat without getting the fire department called on me. Shoot in my backyard without getting the police called on me. Walk down the road without being worried about getting mugged. Leave my keys in the car without worrying about it being stolen. And have enough disposable income, due to my dramatically lower cost of living, that if the wife and I want to take in a Broadway show, we can fly up, do it, and then fly home. ",268,"&gt;I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone.

Honestly, this just shows a lack of maturity and a fundamental lack of knowledge about the human condition. 

&gt;Cities have bigger and better libraries

OK... but I don't need a big library. I just need a kiosk that is part of the intra-library loan program. When I want to read a book, I do it from home.

&gt;schools

This is rather obviously not the case. Public schools in major cities are cesspools, and achieve worse results with more funding than suburban or rural schools. 

&gt;police/fire departments

I don't know of any way to measure this, other than to say that my sheriff's office has cleared 100% of the homicides in my county in the last 10 years... how's your city doing in that regard?

&gt;hospitals

Sure

I've got some bad news for you, there, bucko. Gas, both of the gasoline and natural varieties, is cheaper in the country.

","&gt;there is a greater range of things to do

I would greatly dispute this.  Few cities have any decent opportunities for hiking, kayaking, sailing, hunting, trapping, fishing, birding, shooting, or a great deal of other activities.  When I find myself in a city for whatever reasons, I find myself quickly getting bored due to the lack of interesting things to do.

&gt;There are theatres

Small towns have those too.

&gt;large public events

This is a negative to me.  I can only think of one large public event that I enjoy, and it involves camping.

&gt;strip clubs

Don't need or want them.

&gt;meetings of like-minded people and clubs

These are pretty easy to find out in the country.

&gt;just about anything to do if you ever get bored

Like I stated before, cities have a severe lack of most of the sorts of things I like doing.

&gt;Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity

This can also effectively be achieved by having a mile or so in between your house and your neighbour's.  You never have to see another human if you don't want to.  Cities are just so crowded and there are people everywhere.  In a city, I feel like I can't snese without accidentally invading someone's space, and I certainly have no hope of having no one invade mine.  In the right place country, I could set off a bomb and no one would give a shit.

&gt;bugs

&gt;holy fucking shit the bugs

This is actually a major plus to me.  In the city, I'm lucky to see a single Black Saddlebags, but in the country I can see a wide range of different insects.  As someone with a fascination for entomology, this is a fantastic experience to me.  The only bugs I don't like are things like gnats and mosquitoes, but you get those in cities just as much as you do in the country.  Maybe even more so, depending on the place.

&gt;In the country, everything is high maintenance.

&gt;Since just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.

Sounds like you are making stuff up.  I have not experienced any appliances having significantly shorter lives in the country.  It is pretty easy to keep things clean even living far from other people.  Living in the country is not the same as camping.

Overall, I can't imagine ever being able to live in a city.  Most cities I measure how long I can stand to be in them in hours (the best cities rate days).  A few cities I would only be able to stand a few minutes and at least one I found so terrible that I refuse to ever go there again.

Edit:  I forgot to point out the most important one: ""Everything is closer in the city"".  I love having space and having things further apart means more space.  Having things closer together is a big negative to me and is the main reason that I would not be able to ever stand living in the city.",r2,0.2,0.3,0.6,0.7,0.2,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.3,0.5,0.1,0.5,0.6,0.3,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.2,r1,,
"I'll start off by saying I'm a vegetarian and I also try to limit the eggs and dairy I eat, I try to buy no leather and no other animal byproducts. When there are leftovers from dinners with guests, etc. I'll eat that (throwing meat away is definitely worse than eating it). I try to do as much as I can for the environment and animals, I have very little money so I do not donate to animal rights organizations but I certainly would if I could.

I'm trying to be as reasonable as possible on the subject, I try not to see individuals as evil 'cause they think it's normal to torture animals, I understand it's a cultural thing although I loathe humanity in general.

I also think the hypothetical contribution of even a billion of the strictest vegans imaginable wouldn't change things a bit.

As of today I'm making this choice exclusively because it makes me feel good / at peace with myself, 'cause if I think about the contribution to the environment, I'm sorry but I just can't believe I'm doing anything significant.

I'm 100% convinced on what I've done for a year now, and I'll become as ""vegan"" as possible in the future (I hate this whole ""vegan"" thing, it should be something natural like being against slavery), I'm NOT looking for an excuse to quit. But I know it'll only benefit my ethics and my self-esteem.

I know that for every person like me (and I'm nowhere near good) there are one thousand who don't give a damn. I know that there are TENS OF BILLIONS animals being tortured for food, and unless the world miraculously turns vegan overnight, there's no chance any of this will change. Change my view.

On the eating leftovers thing, I also have to add.. I've been to a wedding recently and I got vegetarian courses, it was really no hassle for anyone... but I looked at the courses with fish and meat and I just thought of all the stuff they'd be throwing away that day... if I ate meat and fish that day it would have made NO difference at all... maybe it would have been better, saved the cook some work...

For me the key point is not BUYING meat rather than not eating it, I get it, and having vegetarian stuff served that day and making things look positive for everyone and having conversations with others about being vegetarian was a positive thing... but the actual contribution to things? That restaurant probably threw away ten times what I could have eaten. It's depressing.

I still recommend that people switch to a vegetarian (or vegan) lifestyle, I think it's a GOOD thing by all means. It's a fantastic feeling, it's healthy, and a million other things. As I said I haven't stopped believing in the lifestyle and I'll never quit. I just believe the actual contribution to the environment and the well being of animals is insignificant, and expecting results is hopeless.

**I have found a convincing argument and I think that made me change my mind. Although many answers were backed up by very uplifting data, I couldn't justify changing my mind since I couldn't help but believe things are changing way too slowly, and that the damage might still be irreparable in the long run.**

&gt; Eventually — not soon, but maybe in a generation or two — I would not be surprised if the majority of people on the liberal side of the fence started to shun meat-eating, as has happened with social issues in recent years. And at that point, changes will be sweeping and sudden.

I have never thought about critical mass. I still believe the situation is a lot more complex than just the West, but even believing that one day a relatively sudden change could happen like it did with LGBT rights based on public opinion reaching critical mass makes me believe there's something to look for behind the hard numbers.

**Another great argument with links**

&gt; In short, the reality is: It adds up.  
[Does Veganism Make a Difference?](http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Utilitarianism/Does%20Veganism%20Make%20a%20Difference.htm)  
[Expected Utility, Contributory Causation, and Vegetarianism](http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/thresholds.pdf)  
Both of these essays approach your question in a statistics-based manner that focuses on thresholds. They propose that your effect on meat production is a measurable probability.  
In other words, they ask questions like, ""What are the odds that your purchase of, say, a frozen turkey will be the one that causes your grocery store to order another entire shipment of frozen turkeys? And that that shipment causes the food distributor to order more turkeys? And that that shipment causes a farm to slaughter more turkeys?""

"This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don’t think alien life exists elsewhere in the universe, you’re crazy. I understand where this view comes from; the [Universe is so unimaginably huge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17jymDn0W6U) and so filled with [galaxies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAVjF_7ensg), and therefore stars, and therefore [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exoplanets_discovered_using_the_Kepler_spacecraft), there simply *must* be other life out there. My view is that this approach is fundamentally unscientific and should not be held because it is based on probability and not actual scientific evidence.

My background: I am a physics and astronomy teacher, and I teach about this subject in depth every year. I think about it and research it often. I’m well acquainted with the [Drake Equation](https://xkcd.com/384/), the [Fermi Paradox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNhhvQGsMEc) and [its many possible solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI), the [Great Filter](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html), and the debate over alien life in general.

My own belief in the matter used to be strongly on the ‘of course aliens exist out there’ side, but I thought the distances were just too vast for us to ever observe them. However, my opinion was strongly shifted by the book *Alone in the Universe* by [John Gribbin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gribbin), and I now think that the great profusion of life here on Earth is so rare that we are alone in the Universe.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m completely open to the idea of aliens existing. I kind of hope they do, as long as they don’t destroy us all! But until we get any kind of scientific evidence that they exist — an organized signal, clear alien-made trace elements on a planet’s spectroscopy, anything measurable — I think the correct scientific approach is that they don’t exist. CMV.

Edit 1: Some good thoughts in here, thanks. Also, some incorrect assumptions about what I'm saying. Probability is of course a useful scientific tool, the key to our understanding of quantum mechanics. But guesses about the Drake Equation boil down to probability based on no data, quite different from the data-based probability of QM.

The most compelling argument that I've read below is that because we know life happened once in the Universe with us, it could happen again. Physical laws of symmetry point to the idea that there are no unique events in the Universe. I'm not sure I agree with that, but it's given me something to think about. And so the crux of the argument comes down to abiogenesis, life from non-life. Is it easy or hard? Could it have happened only once? *Alone in the Universe* argues that a LOT of things had to go just right for us to exist. I call these things 'Drake's Denominator' in class -- the scores of things that went just right for us that might kill the huge totals of galaxies, stars, and planets.

Edit 2: Delta awarded, thanks all for your thoughts. I realized that even the single data point we have about life, life here on Earth, makes it possible for other life to exist out there. We don't have any evidence yet, but it's not unscientific to imagine that it exists. I still think life is exceedingly rare out there, and perhaps we're alone. The strange thing is that we'll probably never know. The story about [Vlad the Astrophysicist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPl10L40pBM) is closer to my main view about aliens in general -- civilizations pop in and out of existence in no time at all, never having the chance to reach out across space and communicate.

Evolutionary theory is generally not considered something that you believe in, but since some Christians deny evolutionary theory they effectively don't believe in it. Also, I am going to be using Christianity as my reference religion, but other Abrahamic religions that contain the genesis story are applicable as well.

_____

The theory of evolution that gives an explanation as to our origins I believe is not compatible with Christianity. You cannot believe in evolution as well as the Christian genesis story because they directly contradict each other. The Christian genesis story states that god created man in his current form, while evolutionary theory explains that life took millions of years to evolve and that our species is descended from a common ancestor with the other primates.

If you are a Christian who believes in evolution as opposed to the genesis story and claim that the Christian genesis is just a metaphor, you open the door for the entire rest of the bible to be just a metaphor as well. Beyond that, if you claim that Christian genesis is just a metaphor because it isn't actually true in a literal sense, then you can further extend that the entire bible isn't true in a literal sense.

If someone were to claim that only the genesis story is a metaphor but the rest is literally true, then that person has effectively filtered the bible themselves. For a person to pick and choose what is real and what is not in a sacred book is to not hold the book sacred. Finally, for a person to not hold the bible sacred is to not be a Christian. Evolutionary theory and Christianity are not compatible. CMV!

"First Let me just say I am 16 and don't have much experience with how it is in the 'adult world'. But I don't think a 100% platonic relationship can exist between a straight male and a straight female. 

Can you think back to any friendship and say with absolute certainty that there was never even a hint of attraction? And even if you can, how do you know they don't or never haven't felt that way?

It doesn't even need to be acted on to affect the relationship. It often with subconsciously. From my personal experience, this sort of friendship doesn't exist. 

So, change my view, Reddit! 
","This sort of logic seems a bit backwards to me.  To me, a relationship is not possible without the people being friends first.

"Hi! I'm trying to learn feminism -- which is a huge topic, and like all huge topics, has it's good and bad. I was recently introduced to the scathing disdain for the ""not all men"" sentiment. 

I'd like to start out by establishing a few things, because it's important to know that I don't support using this sentiment broadly.

1. Where a victim is grieving, confiding, venting, or however else they are dealing with a problem, it is an inappropriate time to use ""not all men"". The focus belongs on the victim and their healing at that time, not nitpicking their wording.
2. ""Not all men"", in the way I'm using it here, is actually ""not all X"", where X is any group in a discussion that has a broad, negative statement said toward their group. We see it most frequently thanks to the (most often deserving) scorn targeted at the ""not all men"" sentiment, but I do mean Not all X, where X is any group.

###The value of accurate language

As a young boy, when I said ""women are bad at math"", my father corrected me. He said ""some women are bad at math"". When my brother said ""you never let me go to town,"" he corrected him by saying ""I usually don't, but here are the times I did"". My father took issue with ""global"" language, as he called it, no matter what form it came in, because he saw it as harmful.

Have you ever felt a burden to prove you're some blanket statements that was often leveled against your kind? ""Women are bad at math"", or ""women cry so easily"", or ""blacks are stupid"", or ""feminist hate men"". For me personally, when I saw ""men are so shallow"" growing up I felt a sense of hostility from the statement. It felt like a judgement against me, and I felt like I had to carry the burden to show people that even though men are shallow, I'm a man and I'm not.

The point is, if we use careful speech, like ""I hate it when men are shallow / some men are so shallow"", OR ""It really bothers me a woman cries over the smallest thing"" and ""some women cry so easily"", we avoid creating broad, negative labels.  These labels can create a great sense of shame in the targeted group, and this shame fosters a sense of otherness. Instead of the shamed person feeling included or a part of something, they feel excluded. This, and the shame can also sabotage a person's self value and chance at success.

By biggest concern is the sense of otherness it can create, driving away potential allies, and by god we need a lot of allies to address the institutionalized racism and sexism in most western nations.

**Therefore**

1. I believe it is in the best interest of those seeking to address an oppressive culture to use accurate language in order to be inclusive to as many as possible, to maximize their efforts
2. Just as it is the responsibility of the privileged to not use broad, negative language to describe the oppressed, it's also (far down on the priority list) the responsibility of the oppressed to not use broad, negative language to describe the privilege. Because, really, it's a human's responsibility to a human to not use broad, negative language against a human. To a reasonable length, of course,  and I d not believe adding ""some"" before men, women, asians, etc, is much of a stretch.

###Picking an appropriate time

Again, the time to say ""not all X"" is not when a victim is trying to overcome their harm. But in casual conversation, as a small aside, it is good for all people to correct others when they use this harmful, broad language.

####Conclusion / TL;DR: No matter the group, broad language assigning negative traits to another group is harmful, and it is our responsibility as humans to take reasonable efforts to avoid propagating this harm, starting first with ourselves, second in mild conversation, and never while a victim is trying to overcome harm. We should never become comfortable using broad, negative language.

"I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several reasons to holdthis view - here they are, sorted by relevance (from least to most relevant). 

* They eat poo.
* They are annoying. Many people have really strong opinions against smoking in public, because it is upsetting them and accordingly laws have been past in many countries that limit/prohibit smoking in public transport, public buildings, etc. However, it is not uncommon to be leg-humped by a dog in the bus, or step into dog-poo in the park, which I find really annoying. This seems to be regarded as unproblematic, some pepole even get annoyed if you do not want to touch their animal companion with questionable hygiene standards.* You may say that (contrary to smoking) these are merely inconveniences, but in fact...
* ...Some dogs are plain dangerous. Have a look at the [""Fatal dog attacks""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States) wiki entry. Granted, there are MUCH more people dying from cars, cigaretts, cancer (and that's only deadly stuff with a C), etc. but in my opinion even one person would be too much. There are a lot of young children on the list as well. 
* My rant so far may have given you the opinion that I just hate animals. However, the opposite is true - I love them! Therefore I think we shouldn't keep them for our amusement or because we fancy a walk once or twice a day. 
* They eat. In a world where people are starving this is in my opinion morally not justifiable. 
* Most importantly: They produce greenhouse gases - and quite a lot of them! [The co2-""paw print"" of a big dog that gets fed mostly meat may even be bigger than the emissions caused by an SUV.](http://www.salon.com/2014/11/20/the_surprisingly_large_carbon_paw_print_of_your_beloved_pet_partner/)

Therefore I am convinced that you probably shouldn't own a dog. I will not be convinced by single examples where a dog was useful, but by reasons why the overall benefits of private dog-owenership surpass the negetive effects I have listed above. Please CMV!

(*)The fanatic dog-loving may be an issue particular to Germany.



**EDIT: Deltas have been awarded to the argument that dogs ""sage lives"" by providing companionship, and helping with mental as well as physical health issues. It may therefore be argued that these safed lives make up for the harm that dogs cause elsewhere. Thanks to /u/stoopydumbut, /u/RustyRook, and /u/jiw123. (Others have also made the same point later). Thanks for the interesting discussion. At the very least I learned that I am pretty alone in my distaste for dog poo :)**

**EDIT 2: Ok, it's 3am where I am and I think all arguments that can be made about the issue have been made. Good night and thanks again for the discussion!**

"*[This article](https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/12/health-risk-having-gun-home) does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/defensive-gun-ownership-gary-kleck-response-115082.html#.Vdm1n_lVhBc) that lays out some criticisms of the first article's source study, along with a rebuttal from another journalist who's written on the topic.*

I believe that:

1. You, or someone in your family, are more likely to be killed by your gun either purposefully or accidentally than you are to use the gun against an attacker successfully in self-defense.

2. Therefore, if your goal is to make yourself and/or your family safer, then choosing to keep a gun in your home explicitly for that purpose is an irrational decision.


I do believe there is one exception to this. If you have a particular reason or belief that you are likely to be attacked, then, since the odds of being attacked have increased dramatically, then it may be rational to have a gun in the house for self-defense. For example, if you have a stalker. If you have received threats on your life. If you have any reasonable belief that someone will try to harm you specifically. If government or police forces have broken down. Basically, if the odds change so that for you the risk of you or your family being attacked is greater than the risk of having a gun in the house, then it would be rational to have a gun.

But we do know, statistically, on average, that is not the case. So for the average person, the risks are such that the rational decision for maximizing safety is to not keep a gun.

I further believe that if you get other uses out of the gun other than just self-defense, then the other added benefits of having a gun would make it rational to keep one in the house. For example, if somebody was a hunter and or target shooter and they get a lot of joy out of their hobby, that could be worth the risk of gun ownership. Or even if someone cited tradition, or the need of an armed populace as a check on the government, that too could be a perceived benefit to them that makes the safety risk worthwhile. I'm strictly speaking about what's the best decision for maximizing personal and family safety.

Change my view by showing me that the risk of harm to you or your family is lower by having a fire arm in the house.

"Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said:

What happens after the honeymoon period when one person still desires sex, but their partner has lost interest (commonly referred to as a [dead bedroom](http://reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms))?

I think it's still the duty of the disinterested party to at least minimally fulfill the sexual needs of their partner, if sustaining the relationship is a priority. In bullet form, here's why:

* Each partner in the relationship is the others' only source of intimacy and sex (assuming a monogamous relationship), therefore if one partner withholds sex, the physical needs of the other is not being met. What is ultimately a chore or an inconvenience for one partner is a physiological necessity for the other.

* Compromise is fundamentally part of every aspect of a relationship, and sex is no different. I'm conflicted in my thinking on this point: No one should be made to have sex if they don't want to. However, both my SO and I do things for each other that we don't necessarily want to do because it's better for the relationship, or it makes the other happy. I don't believe sex and intimacy should be treated differently- it's reasonable to have expectations of sex as a requirement of the relationship.

Thoughts?","The problem with sex as an obligation is that it equates to a sort of penance.  No one wants to live their life in perpetual punishment for the disinterest in sex.  

Also, even if they were to agree *most people* are somewhat aware of their partner's feelings.  Having sex with a partner who performs the act with the same interest as most of us have while cleaning our bathroom is a losing proposition.  Louis CK has a great skit on [The saddest Hand job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=betkymYDzfg).  The short of it is that his wife agrees to giving him a hand job after a long time of not being sexual with him in any way.  He should feel excited, but instead he feels pathetic, rejected and resentful of her.  ","Sex is *not* a physiological necessity. Simple as that. It has physiological benefits, but you don't need it to survive.

Sex is, for all intents and purposes, a hobby that you share with your partner, and yes, it is fulfilling in a way that many other activities aren't, but you won't die without it. You won't get sick without it. It won't take years off your life, or even impair your psychological performance, if you aren't getting laid.

Having that fulfillment is great, but it's not a necessity in your life, and moreover it is selfish to assume that just because your partner is disinterested in sex they are also no longer in need of that fulfillment and you are somehow more entitled to it than they are.

When your partner loses interest in sex, something is probably happening with their body or their mind that should be addressed by *both* parties. If otherwise healthy, sexual people are having problems with sexual interest, the first step is not obligation-sex. It's doctors visits. Depression, high estrogen/low testosterone, reproductive disorders, malnutrition, anxiety, vaginismus, and bacterial infections are just a FEW of the physical and psychological reasons why sustained disinterest in sex might be a problem. It's rarely ""I'm just not attracted to you anymore"" (and when that's the case, if sex is a requirement in your relationship, it's time to terminate that relationship).

And for people with libido high enough to cause them physical discomfort or adverse effects when their sexual desires aren't being met, I'd actually argue that a more equitable solution would be to speak to a doctor about that, too. A high enough sex drive that you NEED to have sex regularly on a physical level should be addressed medically, not by contractually violating another person's right to choose whether or not they have sex.

"I am a fan of many sports, and all of them seem to take a lot of skill. But golf has always been the one I hated. It's always been boring to me, and it seems that when compared to other sports, golf takes the least skill. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying professional golfers aren't extremely talented, golf is not easy, but compared to anything else, it's nothing. In every other sport, your skill set has to be very large, and you have to be very good at many things. Baseball for instance; you need to be able to bat, field and run. In soccer, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and shoot. In basketball, again, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and be able to shoot. But in golf, you just have to be able to hit a ball towards the hole, and you can only do that one way.

But my point still stands, aside from that.","&gt;**But in golf, you just have to be able to hit a ball towards the hole, and you can only do that one way.**

"Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important /  better than others from different countires. This further highlights physical and cultural differences keeping race, creed and skin colour at the forefront of discrimination.

Your land mass of preference is nothing more than a matter of circumstance and the nationals of your country are just as much of a burden on the planet as the foreigners these rituals imply are second rate.

Edit: This has necessarily expanded into a discussion on 

- Social economics
- Patriotism vs nationalism

In terms of economics: Please assume any reference to this is intended to express public (and occasionally at a push, social) benefits. The reasoning for doing so is to hopefully highlight how national identity can be a) relative to your perceptions of ""lesser countries"". b) a productive of abusing of nations / collections of nations. e.g, DDT ban once the rest of the world no longer needed America for its production.

"First I think I should make all the clarifications I can.  By ""true Christian,"" I mean someone that does their absolute best to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ.  A ""true Christian"" actively analyzes his or her own behavior and actively attempts to better themselves based on Jesus's teachings.  And by ""behavior,"" I specifically refer to relationships with others, social interactions, lifestyle, and actions over words. 

By ""support the United States,""  I want to refer specifically to U.S. foreign policy and action, specifically the current/recent wars in the middle east.  Also think about matters such as:

-support of the state of Israel (not condeming it's terrible actions) 

-CIA/blackops/paramilitary operations around the world

-backing of dictators and tyrants because they do the bidding of corporate interests

-use of torture

-use of drone strikes





I was raised as a Christian (ECLA Lutheran) and although I am now an agnostic, the moral teachings of Jesus and Christianity have not left me.  Here is my understanding of Christianity and the teachings of Jesus, and I will also say that every civil, intelligent conversation I have had about religion has ended with these same conclusions:

-Everyone should try their very best to follow the golden rule, the second commandment, or whatever you want to call it:  ""Love thy neighbor as thyself,""  ""treat others how you want to be treated,"" etc.  It's a pretty universal moral code amongst humanity, but is specifically important to Christianity

-People are not perfect.  They commit sins.  But if you try to live your life to the best of your ability following the golden rule, to care for and love others as yourself, and confess your sins to be forgiven by Jesus/God, then you will be saved.  You can get into all the ins and outs of the ""resurrection,"" but when it comes down to it, the sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus is to forgive the sins of those who attempt to live good lives and sincerely admit/confess their sins.  If you don't actually mean it and feel remorse, it's meaningless.

-God is love, submit yourself to the will of God, humble yourself before God, you are nothing compared to God, love God with all of your heart, etc.

Here are some relevant Jesus quotes:

""A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.""

""But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.""

""For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul?""

""If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.""

""I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.""

""For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.""

""Give to everyone who begs from you; and of him who takes away your goods do not ask them again. And as you wish that men would do to you, do so to them.""

""All the commandments: You shall not commit adultery, you shall not kill, you shall not steal, you shall not covet, and so on, are summed up in this single command: You must love your neighbor as yourself.""

""For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?""

Now the main reason why I disaffiliated myself from Christianity can be best described by a quote of Gandhi: “I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.”  That and I realized there is a high probability that Jesus did not actually exist, at least as we fantasize him as having supernatural powers.  But the teachings and moral code of Jesus/Christianity is an entirely separate entity that exists outside of any supernatural belief.  And it is this observation that makes me ask why/how the United States can call itself a Christian nation and do the things it does?  Or you substitute ""Christain nation"" for ""morally superior"" or some other similar term.  I think it's a fairly prominent belief here that ""we are the good guys,"" so whatever we have to do to maintain our power and lifestyle, we are absolutely justified in doing.  But how can you be a true Christian, and actively support that?  That seems to directly contradict the teachings of Jesus in so many ways.  Please prove me wrong.  And please provide specific examples.

"Under the assumption that you can consciously alter your wants, it seems to me that the obvious solution to a more peaceful life is to reduce your material wants towards zero.  This would include departing from things as basic to the developed world as air conditioning.  I don't see any benefit to wanting more material goods in life, even though I, unfortunately, still want more than I have.

This is less a moral argument than a practical argument.  If you can reduce your wants to non-material desires, then the material provisions you should require to satisfy those desires should be meager; a pair of shoes, a shirt and pants to walk through park; books to read; etc.; and your life should, therefor, be easier and more free.  

Again, this is under the assumption that you can alter your wants.  Specifically, the capacity to want to want something -- wanting to want to exercise, wanting to want to read more, wanting to want less, etc. -- is the basis of this view point, and I'm curious if anyone has a compelling argument towards actually wanting to want more material goods.

**CLARIFICATION:  My claim is NOT that ""The goal of life should be to reduce your material wants to zero.""**","Your title and your conjecture say slightly different things. One saying that the goal (end game) of life is to reduce material wants. The other saying that you reduce material wants to obtain a more peaceful life.

I would argue that 
1) there is no ""goal"" in life 
2) a peaceful life is not one that is better

1) The only result of life is death, no matter what moves you make during life, the result is always the same. If you become enlightened before you die, if you become a millionaire before you die, if you climb the worlds tallest mountain before you die, nothing changes about the end result. A goal in itself, would just be one additional ""want"", and nothing more.

2) A peaceful life, would be one without disturbance. This means a life without change, a life without stimulus. The more stimulus and change there are the more chaotic the life and less peaceful it becomes. The state with the least change and stimulus is death, the opposite of life. 

And a want is hardly a quantifiable thing. I want one thing: absolute happiness. How many other wants are going to be piled into making that one want happen? Even if you want a small quantified able thing say a cup of tea in the morning, there are other wants that need to be met to reach that, such as living in a place were tea is available. And then what about when that cup of tea is consumed, do we simply slip into a catatonic state until the desire for the next cup of tea arises?

Wants drive us, and give us purpose. Less wants may in fact make us more peaceful, but I don't think that is necessarily an ideal state.","What about material desires that drive life aspiration.

This means healthy food, access to things that promote good health.  I need to read news/books/ things to stay up to date and relevant to support the continuous growth of my charity.

I know a lot of people I consider friends that have political views that I don't agree with at all, and I don't know if letting everyone know how I feel about these situations is worth ruining that.

I have also heard quotes about how doing/saying nothing is worse than being against it, and that during the civil rights movement most people were silent which was definitely a bad thing, but I'm not sure if it's worth speaking up.

Some of your closer friends are probably already aware that you don't share their political views. So choose the ones among them who you think you could have a conversation with and roll with it. If you're sure you do want to discuss it it's a good idea to lay the groundwork and then talk about it in person.

Discussing it in person gets ideas across very well because tone and body language can be used to guide the direction of the conversation, which is often impossible on facebook.","Just find the right people to discuss these things with.

"Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I am not saying anything against this definition. If the experts want to define things this way, I'm certainly in no position to say otherwise.

However, ""Black is a color"" should still be a valid statement. My shirt is 'black.' I'm not a color-physicist, but I'm almost certain that it does not completely absorb the full spectrum of colors. If I wanted to be totally correct, I would have to say: ""My shirt is a color that very nearly approximates black."" (Disproving this would be a very easy way to CMV!)

There are enough black-colored items in the world for this to be ridiculous. Thus, it's only logical that when we are casually talking to other humans, and mention the word 'black,' it can be assumed that we're referring to this close-enough faux-black, which does reflect (I'd assume) some light, and thus is totally a color. 

The argument for white follows similarly.

Edit: I'm not saying that it's wrong to say that black and white aren't colors. I'm saying that it's okay to say that they are, in certain contexts.

The whole point of communication is to get a point across. This means that different communities define things differently in a way that suits their own needs. When artists talk about a painting needing more colour, other artists will intuitively know that this means add colours that are not black or white.

If your day to day life involves talking about colour all the time, you should have an established definition of what counts as a colour so everyone's on the same page. At the end of the day it doesn't matter, it's just to ensure proper communication.

"Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to accept a lot of things... But I have trouble understanding the reasoning behind gender dysphoria and all of that. I identify as my biological sex, yet I really feel more 'feminine' than 'masculine'. Yet I don't really believe in either term due to their outdated definitions and all of that nonsense.

I'm not a very spiritual person. And I don't believe in a lot 'outside' of what we can percieve. Yes I believe there's more to the world, but I don't believe in anything beyond biological sex. Of course it's not binary. Intersex people very obviously exist, that's just scientific fact.

"I'll start off by saying I'm a vegetarian and I also try to limit the eggs and dairy I eat, I try to buy no leather and no other animal byproducts. When there are leftovers from dinners with guests, etc. I'll eat that (throwing meat away is definitely worse than eating it). I try to do as much as I can for the environment and animals, I have very little money so I do not donate to animal rights organizations but I certainly would if I could.

I'm trying to be as reasonable as possible on the subject, I try not to see individuals as evil 'cause they think it's normal to torture animals, I understand it's a cultural thing although I loathe humanity in general.

I also think the hypothetical contribution of even a billion of the strictest vegans imaginable wouldn't change things a bit.

As of today I'm making this choice exclusively because it makes me feel good / at peace with myself, 'cause if I think about the contribution to the environment, I'm sorry but I just can't believe I'm doing anything significant.

I'm 100% convinced on what I've done for a year now, and I'll become as ""vegan"" as possible in the future (I hate this whole ""vegan"" thing, it should be something natural like being against slavery), I'm NOT looking for an excuse to quit. But I know it'll only benefit my ethics and my self-esteem.

I know that for every person like me (and I'm nowhere near good) there are one thousand who don't give a damn. I know that there are TENS OF BILLIONS animals being tortured for food, and unless the world miraculously turns vegan overnight, there's no chance any of this will change. Change my view.

On the eating leftovers thing, I also have to add.. I've been to a wedding recently and I got vegetarian courses, it was really no hassle for anyone... but I looked at the courses with fish and meat and I just thought of all the stuff they'd be throwing away that day... if I ate meat and fish that day it would have made NO difference at all... maybe it would have been better, saved the cook some work...

For me the key point is not BUYING meat rather than not eating it, I get it, and having vegetarian stuff served that day and making things look positive for everyone and having conversations with others about being vegetarian was a positive thing... but the actual contribution to things? That restaurant probably threw away ten times what I could have eaten. It's depressing.

I still recommend that people switch to a vegetarian (or vegan) lifestyle, I think it's a GOOD thing by all means. It's a fantastic feeling, it's healthy, and a million other things. As I said I haven't stopped believing in the lifestyle and I'll never quit. I just believe the actual contribution to the environment and the well being of animals is insignificant, and expecting results is hopeless.

**I have found a convincing argument and I think that made me change my mind. Although many answers were backed up by very uplifting data, I couldn't justify changing my mind since I couldn't help but believe things are changing way too slowly, and that the damage might still be irreparable in the long run.**

&gt; Eventually — not soon, but maybe in a generation or two — I would not be surprised if the majority of people on the liberal side of the fence started to shun meat-eating, as has happened with social issues in recent years. And at that point, changes will be sweeping and sudden.

I have never thought about critical mass. I still believe the situation is a lot more complex than just the West, but even believing that one day a relatively sudden change could happen like it did with LGBT rights based on public opinion reaching critical mass makes me believe there's something to look for behind the hard numbers.

**Another great argument with links**

The number of animals produced and slaughtered is so high that the very small probability of you sparing an animal from it still translates to 50-100 animals per year. And in my opinion, that's significant.

"Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view i hold.  My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any or all of them or bring up new issues I haven't thought of.  

1) Unpopular: The draft for the war in Vietnam was extremely unpopular with massive protests and draft dodging.  After the draft was eliminated the protests died down even as the war continued.  It seems that America will support a lot of military activity (Iraq War 1 &amp; 2, Afghanistan, etc) as long as they are not personally forced to serve.  

2) No close border crisis: Other modern developed countries have forced selective service (South Korea, Israel) but usually these countries face bordering existential crises to their very existence.  America does not have this, has not ever had this, and presumably will not ever have this and so there is no need to have millions of men and women be conscripted every year for a tour of duty.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription

3) Nuclear Weapons: America may face small attacks here and there but no nation state large enough to possibly overthrow the United States government seems likely to attack for fear of nuclear weapons retaliation.  While 9/11 was a tragedy, there was no hope of terrorists taking over the country or overthrowing the government.  The only world forces strong enough to do this would be large nations with large militaries of their own and if they did have a mainland ground force invasion of US soil it would almost guarantee a nuclear response.

4) Women, and the out of shape:  This is a minor reason but none the less I'll bring it up for discussion.  In a modern draft there would be seemingly no way for women to avoid serving.  Currently women face demanding physical aptitude tests to qualify for the most demanding positions or in some cases are barred from service for fear they will not be able to handle the physical requirements of the job (front line combat, Navy Seals, etc).  In the 21st century when men and women have equal rights and are largely treated equally there would be pushback if those less capable of serving were thought to be more likely to get an easier or safer assignment.  This would create a race to the bottom for applicants seeking to avoid dangerous duty.  Furthermore the vast majority of Americans are overweight, out of shape, and would require extensive training to become combat ready.  If diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, or any number of conditions would disqualify a person from service I imagine people would quickly engage in unhealthy habits (or bribe doctors) in order to avoid service. 

5) Conscientious objectors: In previous generations there was a much stronger sense of duty, warrior culture, and sense of imminent danger which cultivated a value in service.  In the modern world, where people increasingly distrust their government, have more access to information, and are more likely to have diverse religious and philosophical views I do not see the public getting behind any major military involvement that would require a draft.  I would imagine there would be a rush to qualify yourself as a conscientious objector to the war in order to avoid combat even if that individual didn't feel that way immediately prior to the draft.  

Please change my view!","On your Point 3 (Nukes):  We will have, in the next 50 years, the ability to defeat ICBM's.  It is not unthinkable that China, Russia and India will also have this ability.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that any warhead capable of delivering a nuke (at present sizes) will be able to be defeated prior to detonation.  Whether this is due to anti-missile shields, laser technology or targeted EMP's, it does not matter.  Once nukes are a non-factor, the single largest strategic problem with going to war with another country is gone.  States that don't have to worry about their interests being nuked are much more likely to send the ground troops in.

On your point 4 (Women and the Out of Shape):  I see no reason that our current health problems will stop us from drafting people.  The training may be longer and more involved, but where their is a requirement, there is a way in the US Military.  As for women, I look forward to the day women are eligible for the draft.  But just because they are drafted does not mean they will be automatically able or fit to do all jobs.  They will be assigned to the jobs that they can do well at.

On point 5 (CO's):  You have to prove your CO status.  This has always been true.  Access to info will only make people more ready for it.  But if 5-10 more people out ov every 1000 do qualify, you still have 990.  You can play with those numbers, but I am not convinced that this is a problem that will completely negate the benefit a government would get out of a draft.","The US will revert to a draft as soon as the US deems it necessary - which is when the number of volunteers do not met the numbers required.

Once nukes are a non-factor, the single largest strategic problem with going to war with another country is gone.  States that don't have to worry about their interests being nuked are much more likely to send the ground troops in.

On your point 4 (Women and the Out of Shape):  I see no reason that our current health problems will stop us from drafting people.  The training may be longer and more involved, but where their is a requirement, there is a way in the US Military.  As for women, I look forward to the day women are eligible for the draft.  But just because they are drafted does not mean they will be automatically able or fit to do all jobs.  They will be assigned to the jobs that they can do well at.

On point 5 (CO's):  You have to prove your CO status.  This has always been true.  Access to info will only make people more ready for it.  But if 5-10 more people out ov every 1000 do qualify, you still have 990.  You can play with those numbers, but I am not convinced that this is a problem that will completely negate the benefit a government would get out of a draft.",r2,0.8,0.3,0.7,0.6,0.4,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.3,0.6,0.5,0.3,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.2,r1,,
"I've lived practically my whole life on this phrase. It has shaped how I have made several important decisions in my life, though I have recently come to suspect that this may not be the whole truth.

The phrase itself is fairly explanatory, but the deeper meaning behind it is that you should always be looking for some kind of satisfaction behind your work; Be it a happy customer, or a well-stocked shelf, or a cool painting. There is always something in your work that can grant you at least some menial satisfaction, but if there is not even that much then the work you are doing is not fit for doing.","Coutner-point: there are some professions in which it is perfectly acceptable to not feel satisfaction in what I do but it is definitely still worth doing.

While it is definitely possible to feel satisfaction in doing one's job as a soldier, a great number of soldiers have also described the job of war as immensely unsatisfying and depressing (as they should- while we might feel good about a defense of our homeland, we should definitely have the satisfaction tempered by what the situation has come to). 

An even more extreme example would be an executioner- perhaps you can find a form of non-sadistic satisfaction he can have in his job (perhaps enforcing justice?).

But the point definitely stands- there are times when agents acting as the arm of the broader society have to engage in horrific actions, and it becomes harder to justify your statement.","I think feelings of satisfaction and wellbeing are internal states not directly cause by our job performance. While I agree people should feel satisfied, I don't think the job is the problem. Satisfaction is an internal state.

I have some friends who have felt deeply unsatisfied in professions like teaching, social work, and nursing. And yet I know others who find deep satisfaction in oil and gas, fast food, and big box retail.

I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for drug distribution they can choose to die. This would decrease prison population and relief funding to the prison system. Less people = less taxpayers have to spend. The prisoner would get to choose if they want to die, but the state would perform the execution. This would only apply to people 18 years or older.

Prisoners sometimes have to endure very horrible things while in prison. Rape, sexual assault and violence affect many prisoners that are serving time for theft, drugs, etc. This would also apply to criminals who are terminally ill and suffer everyday from the side effects.
People are given life sentences without parole for non violent offenses sometimes.

I believe it is right to give these criminals an option to end their life's so they don't have to suffer in prison if they don't want to.

I am sure that any mature human can understand this desire and for that emotional reason would advocate for assisted suicide. But to legally define such an ultimate act, what does and does not warrant it, who presides over it, even, who is responsible for it, are such complex questions and I believe are not the responsibility of a governing body.

I would say that the people making such requests are also suffering from a mental condition. It goes against human nature to want to die, in such a dramatic environment I can quite easily see a warped perception of reality in the inmates.

"EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis)used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People who cry 'triggered' because something reminds them of a NON EXTREME incident or issue they are struggling with should not be sheltered or given the attention they are seeking. 

EDIT 2: For some reason I feel that not everybody finished reading my post although theres a tl;dr and a very clear message that my views dont apply to extreme cases like in people who have PTSD yet Im getting all these (actually heartwrenching and very valid arguments) about people with PTSD whom my beef isnt with.

EDIT 3: All in all I think my anger towards modern day 'trigger happu tumblrinas' has somewhat subsided and Im beginning to understand that we cant scruitinise how everybody feels and that some people are stronger than others like one user said and that the effects of triggers on some people can be deadly. 

Thank you all! :)

In 7th and 8th grade I was a snob. This was probably because I am the youngest of five siblings and was fairly better looking than my classmates (before the acne, bad eyesight and crooked teeth kicked in) among other things. 


I realised this because of the way my classmates talked about me and treated me and I took the summer of 8th grade to transform into somebody else. I do not recall how exactly I did it but I did. Everybody was surprised, myself included, that the transformation was permanent and genuine.

Sadly, I was no longer a bitch but a pushover instead. I was bullied shortly after and had a horrible 8 or so years until I graduated from university. During those 8 or so years, my first love died in a car crash, my parents had a terrible accident leaving my mother unable to walk for a year, of course I picked up smoking, I started to serial-date guys and their treatment to me kept getting progressively worse all while I tried to do well at university because it was getting too expensive for my parents to pay for and getting a job wasn't enough for me to sustain myself.

Add to the above a religious struggle between myself, my society and my own mother who didn't talk to me for three months while I lived in the same house as her because of my religious and romantic choices (I was dating a black guy), and you get a fairly broken person.

I didn't trust anyone, I was naive, nervous, insecure, a people pleaser, somewhat promiscuous and a smoker. I did things I never thought I'd do and was put in situations I never wanted to be placed in.


I was even ashamed of my own psychologist whom I never went back to visit after a couple of sessions because of how fucked up I was.

My issues seem trivial but these are just the things that I haven't blocked out. My view does apply to individuals who have gone through everything but EXTREME trauma. 

My POINT is: How can I, and so many people who have gone through worse, emerge as functional if not even better people than we were because of what we went through by using our own logic and reasoning, the help of others, counselling and other resources, while others simply act as if life is supposed to be somehow tailored for them and that whatever 'triggers' them by making them actually have to THINK about what they went through should somehow be erased from their lives?


Tl;dr: Shit happens in life and people should wade through the pile of crap and come out as functional human beings via their own logic rather than project their issues unto others and claim that whatever 'triggers' them to think about their problems must somehow be banished or banned.

Those that do usually suffer from mental illnesses that can cause devestation reflection of an event or memory when brought up. I have ptsd and while i've learned to recognize when i will be triggered it still happens sometimes.

there are people that use this term to gain some sort of control over what others say (tumblrsjw's) and radical feminists of sorts. I first hand know that triggers do exist and i think you should at least acknowledge that they do for some people. sometimes they aren't even words but a situation that will trigger somebody. a few nights ago someone was insulting me because I told my friend ""I hurt myself too much"" and that friends sister went onto her account and started saying that i was a drama queen, that i'm a scrawny white guy who can't even get a job, and other things. That led to a flashback, I am mentally not fit to be in the work force so me ""not being able to get a job"" was a blow to my self esteem that made me spiral downwards into depressive thoughts and finally i had a flashback. now, this is just an example but let me point out a few key things.

1) a part of the reason was because i was already stressed out at the time, i was put into a corner of drama from a few different people before that happened.

2) if there was no stress, I may have been able to identify that i may be close to having an episode.

3) it wasn't 'one word' that caused this, it was a mix of paragraphs of insults.

Triggers do exist and for some they can be far different than others, i do believe someone bringing up rape could 'possibly' trigger a victim into a flashback of what happened, but i doubt that just the word alone would cause it. now if they went to see a movie and there was a disturbing rape scene then that would be more of an understandable trigger. In closing, i somewhat agree with you stating people should be able to overcome our issues. but that doesn't happen out of nowhere in a split second. people struggle for years before they can achieve being better. ","Triggers are certainly real. If you've experienced a traumatic event like rape or witnessing someone's death, there will very likely be something that brings you to a state of distress.

The problem today is that people use the term 'triggered' to label normal feelings of sadness, shame, or embarrassment, resulting in someone who actually has a real trigger not being taken seriously when they say they have a trigger.

Ex. My ex was really abusive and it took almost 2 years of daily full-blown panic attacks to be able to leave the house calmly. Loud noises would set me off, especially doors slamming(I connected this now to him slamming the door when he was mad and I knew I'd be his punching bag). That was an actual trigger for me, but I would never call it that because of all this bullshit tumblrina garbage about triggers. It actually took me almost a year to ask my parents if they could try not to slam the doors because of this. I felt really bad about asking but they were super understanding.

Another, that I still have, is people touching my hair because ONE TIME he yanked me by the hair across the room. I still don't know why I can't get over this one, but it's there and honestly isn't that big of a deal anymore. I just tell people beforehand to not touch my hair and we're cool.

Something that IS NOT a 'trigger' is when someone calls me a bitch or something that he would call me. I just get pissed off at them like any other normal person would. Sure, it sometimes reminds me of when he would say it, but it isn't a trigger. 
For some people who maybe had an abusive upbringing, certain words like 'bitch' COULD be a trigger. But saying it's a trigger for you just because you don't like being called a bitch is just crap.

"Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on to the next news story and give the subject little other thought.

Personally, if I watch videos like this I feel sick and it disturbs me for about half a week.  I cannot forget about them easily.  Just reading about these events does not have this effect and I can forget about the issues relatively quickly.

Secondly I am sure some people cannot visually imagine how horrific these events are.  Being exposed to footage of it will be a shock and a wake up call to how bad life can be for some people.  This in turn will make them more likely to take action.

I will make it plain that I do not think people should be viewing these sorts of videos for entertainment of any kind.

Finally it seems I am not alone, [this article](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/sean-penn-watches-isis-beheading-videos-out-of-moral-obligation-the-problem-is-we-are-not-seeing-enough-of-real-violence-10127603.html) may help you understand my argument better than I can express it.

EDIT:  Some of the responses have made me realise that what I am suggesting would have different effects on different people and as such viewing these videos may not always cause people to act in a positive way as it has with me.

I've already heard lots of people arguing that the artwork is great (and I do agree it is) and that's what makes the film great, but that doesn't cut it for me; the same people who argue in this way don't seem to apply that logic to the other films they watch and so must be adapting their viewing style for Ghibli or just repeating something they heard somewhere else, not responding as they normally would (perhaps with reference to direction, plot, acting, action, scripting, etc) when asked why they like a film.

Any comments or thoughts (outside of 'the artwork is so good') would be appreciated.","One thing you should know is that virtually every Studio Ghibli film revolves around a coming-of-age plot. The plot throws challenges and quick change at immature characters that are unprepared for it, they must adapt and must be brave and show what's inside, their internal struggle is often emphasized.

Also every character, good or bad, has motives and development. Yubaba the bathouse owner is not evil just because, she's got a business to run. The witch of the waste is heartbroken and proud, which leads to wrath. Lady Eboshi cared about her town, employing the marginalized lepers, starting nothing short of an industrial revolution, albeit forgetting the damage to the environment. 

The braveness of characters is also rarely your macho western protagonist willing to face and slice million monsters and then self-immolate. The braveness is often displayed by vulnerable characters that have much to lose and don't have the skills or the strength to chop their way to victory, they must be cunning, firm, and rely on their (often newly made) friends if they want to succeed. 

All this combined with the art and the music, like you mentioned, makes just about every Studio Ghibli film a masterpiece.","I'm unaware of many people who rate movies based on specific criteria outside of movie critics themselves. And even then, most are willing to accept that a movie can be a gestalt, a sum greater than its parts. And even then, critics also accept the visual and spectacle of a movie as being part of whether it's good. Your analysis (or expectation of how someone else would analyze a movie) is almost all technical, which does not speak to the quality of a movie and how it can actually affect people.

So, here are a few things usually part of why Ghibili movies are considered great which also apply to western movies.

1. Visuals. Especially in an era of nearly-realistic CGI, the sheer awe of a visually stunning movie are part of what make it good. When people put Jurassic Park on their lists of best movies, it is in part because of how gorgeous the visuals were. And how that creates the important sense of wonder that drives the rest of the film. See also Gravity. Or the Lord of the Rings, which was lauded in large part for looking the way that movie should look.

2. Characterization. None of the characters are evil for the sake of evil, or lack convictions which are (at the very least) understandable. The Noh isn't malicious, just misunderstood. Now think about how often bad action movies are slammed for lacking good characterization beyond ""gritty tough hero"" and ""bad guy for no apparent reason."" That scarecrow from Howl's moving castle has more characterization without *speaking* than Tony Stark has gotten in five movies.

3. Cohesive, character-driven, plots. Benefits of having good characters is that the plots are not macguffin-driven or rely on happenstance or sins of convenience for resolution. 

4. Acting. Yep, even animated characters can act. First, they're damned expressive as characters. Second, the voice acting is top-notch.

5. Stories, both relatable to the audience and unique. Yes, it takes a bit of suspension of disbelief to believe in the world of Spirited Away, but not much more than the suspension of disbelief for the Avengers. And once that's taken care of, the story itself is relatable. A young child who irresponsibly acts, and needs to fix it? That's old-school Spielberg at his best. A man who has acted selfishly is confronted with the need to consider others (and love) and risks himself to protect others? Yes, some of them are silly, but the ones people consider among the best movies are ones which resonate.

6. Emotional impact. This comes from the characters being fleshed out and relatable, but there are none but the most hard-hearted who don't tear up at the goddamned scarecrow in Howl's moving castle.

"Batman's strict no-killing policy has lead to the deaths of hundreds of people. Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who can stop the Joker. Additionally, it is obvious that Arkham cannot hold him. He has escaped countless times, and every time, Batman has to go recapture him (after he's killed or injured who-knows-how-many people). 

Ostensibly, Batman's no-killing policy is a self imposed check on his inner demons that he is sure will consume him if he gives into them. I believe that, in reality, he uses this policy as a security blanket he can cling to so that he doesn't have to get his hands dirty and make a difficult decision. I think he wraps up his own cowardice in a cloak of self-righteousness (albeit a fireproof, bulletproof cloak).

Here are my main views

1) The only way to stop the Joker is to kill or permanently incapacitate him

2) Batman has a moral obligation to kill or incapacitate the Joker since the state can't or won't do it.

3) He bares responsibility for everyone the Joker harms.

**Important Points** 

* The Joker is responsible for everyone he kills. The full burden of each person's murder is on his head. This CMV in no way negates his responsibility for his actions.

* Batman is **not** equally as responsible as the Joker for the people he kills. I'm not attempting to assign a specific amount of blame to Batman. All I am saying is that he bares some level of responsibility for his refusal to stop the Joker.

* Finally, Batman is not responsible for the people that the Joker killed early on in his career before it became apparent that he could not be contained. 

**Edit**

* If you are against capitol punishment or killing in general, we obviously have an unbridgeable gap here, and cannot possibly come to an agreement

* The only criminal that I am applying this argument to is the Joker. I'm not advocating for Batman to kill anyone else.
","&gt;1) The only way to stop the Joker is to kill him

Batman has more options than just killing the Joker. He could, for instance, kick him in the spine and leave him a paraplegic. Or amputate his limbs. Or call up one of the more mystical members of the justice league to put some kind of curse, enchantment or imprisonment spell on him. There is a wide gulf of stuff Batman could do between ""kill joker"" and ""leave Joker to the authorities"".

Alternatively, Batman could use his considerable wealth to figure out how to get Joker tried in a state or nation that does execute its prisoners. Figure out some way to get Joker tried in Texas, they love executing criminals there.","&gt; 1) The only way to stop the Joker is to kill him

Agreed. That is the only way.

&gt; 2) Batman has a moral obligation to kill the Joker since the state can't or won't do it.

I don't agree. 

&gt; If you are against capitol punishment or killing in general, we obviously have an unbridgeable gap here, and cannot possible come to an agreement

Batman is against this. He is against the killing people and thus he doesn't do it. This belief comes from when his parents were killed.  
You could say that you have an unbridgeable gap between your view and Batman's. 

But Batman has no obligation in whatever way to kill the Joker. He doesn't even have the right to do what he does as a vigilante and he certainly doesn't have a license to kill. Demanding or allowing this would lead to Batman become a precedence for making self-justice acceptable. 

The much bigger question is why hasn't the Joker been executed by the state. But that isn't something to discuss here 

&gt; 3) He bares responsibility for everyone the Joker harms.

He doesn't. If he did then everybody else would bare responsibility. He does not have an obligation to do what he does so there is no way for him to have responsibility or for him to be blamed.  
If anyone then it's the state or city of Gotham that carries responsibility for not securing a safe custody.

A much bigger point (and you said you know this) is that if Batman were to kill he'd basically become something similarly twisted to the Joker. If you want to have a view on what happens when a Superhero throws out his no-killing moral restriction then look at the Injustice storyline where Superman does this (arguably Batman can be almost as bad as Superman with this mentality).",291,"&gt;1) The only way to stop the Joker is to kill him

"A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was entirely removed.

A good sniper has no real counter apart from another sniper, making them frustrating to play against. A majority of the other weapons have damage fall-off to discourage long-range play, further separating the sniper as a class. 

As far as I can tell, snipers mainly exist to pick off slow moving or high value targets, which the spy already does and does in a more interesting (to play as and against) way.

I can't see any way the sniper, sitting at the back of the map away from the action, adds to the game (as a side note, I also think the removal of sniper would do nothing but good for the class diversity on pubs).

Your opinion is not an uncommon one, and I believe the developers have even stated that the sniper added the least to the game out of all the classes, but I think you need to articulate your reasoning better before I or anyone else can attempt to change your view. 

The only point (from a gameplay perspective) I see you've provided is that the sniper is a long range pick class; and there already exists a far more dynamic pick class, the spy. However, the spy is an inconsistent, and thus ineffective, pick class. The range, preparation, patience, luck required to get a backstab on an attentive target (especially when players are actively searching and attempting to stop the spy from reaching a medic or heavy), combined with the fact that you are unlikely to survive after the pick in question is completed, again provided the team is competent enough to have a pyro near the combo to flush you out, makes the spy class hard to play and have little impact on the game. 

If you've ever watched competitive Highlander, you'll notice the spy does very little for most of the game; usually their role is literally that of a spy, to sit with a Cloak and Dagger and report on the enemy's movements. In 6s, spy is the least used class besides engineer. It's because as a pick class, the spy is ineffective most of the time. If you're pub stomping or whatever, then you'll obviously dominate the other team, but a halfway organized team can shut down a decent spy. 

It's necessary to have a class that can provide picks based on purely skill and not luck or the competency of your enemies. There needs to be a pick class that cannot be safeguarded against with little effort, at the cost of less role diversity. That is why the sniper is a very important class to have.","&gt; I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was entirely removed.

Well, an entire group of people would lose their main and would most likely stop playing. Also, all the cosmetics and weapons for sniper would become worthless, which will impact the economy and fuck a lot of people over. 

Now, I'm not a competitive TF2 player, but I can tell you that sniper adds a lot. Without sniper, people don't have to be nearly as careful with their movement. Also, Sniper has the ability to turn the game around by making important picks like demo or medic. Without him, the losing team has a small chance of recovering if they lose an important class. 

As for pubs,  sniper fullfills the same role as he does in competitve, which makes him valuable. 

&gt; A good sniper has no real counter apart from another sniper, making them frustrating to play against

A good sniper can be countered by good spies, good soldiers (depends on the map) and a good scout (depends on the map). Also, if the team is careful and has good movement, average snipers will have a hard time picking them off. 

They're only frustrating to play against if your team sucks, which is true for the rest of the classes as well.

"One of the major policy appeals behind affirmative action is the creation of a diverse environment. A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse one. Universities have done an excellent job in creating an environment that has tons of racial, sexual, ethnic and religious diversity. However, it still lacks intellectual and political diversity. People with conservative or right-wing views are [woefully unrepresented](http://www.criticalreview.com/crf/pdfs/klein_stern.pdf) in academia, particularly in the social sciences. Not only does this make people with conservative political views feel unwelcome and unappreciated in the university environment, it threatens the perceived validity of the research done. [This is even recognized by some leftists themselves](https://inequalitiesblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/right-wing-study-of-inequality/). How are you supposed to have valid research, let alone critical thinking, when there is an absolute hegemony of leftist views, which no one dares challenge due to their overwhelmingly disproportionate power and influence on campus? Therefore, to make university a more diverse environment and encourage critical thinking, we should prioritize student and faculty applicants who are affiliated with right wing organizations, and ensure that peer review panels have at least one right wing professor on them CMV.

Low numbers of right-leaning students and faculty at universities is but a symptom of a far larger problem; Politicism or political discrimination. This is a problem that won't be solved by affirmative action because there are other disincentives for right-leaning people to express their views anywhere.

**Part 1: Politicism outside university**

Our recent general election, and the surprise Conservative victory, lead to an outpouring of hatred and discrimination directed at the Prime Minister, MPs and voters who 'voted wrong'. Not even one day had passed before it descended into violence in the streets of the capital.

[Example 7](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GF87c9Ui_UM/VU5HL7BienI/AAAAAAAAAB8/5EXMiIh5m5Q/s400/Angry%2B6.PNG)

There is a certain level of ""anti-right"" culture emerging in the West whereby the left believes that, because the right are so vile and evil, any level of silencing or hatred directed at the right is justified. Needless to say, the only place I really speak my mind on the subject of politics is anonymously online or with close family. A lot of other people have the same attitude. While I was initially hesitant to call this ""censorship"", based upon the left-wing concept of ""No Platform"" I do now genuinely believe this is censorship, in many cases deliberately done.

**Part 2: The Student Union**

In the UK, students are theortetically represented by the Student Union. At the national level, it is called the NUS (although not all student unions are affiliated with the NUS). This organization is so left-wing that even Maoists would call them loons. 

The NUS, not Universities themselves, [is the primary source of on-campus censorship in the UK.](http://www.spiked-online.com/free-speech-university-rankings/analysis#.VYd03PlVhBc) Pro-life groups are banned at 4 universities. Right-leaning newspaper ""The Sun"" is banned at 26 theoretically for having nude models on Page 3, yet effectively identical content is still available in other publications making the actual motive of censoring right-wing content completely transparent. 

The NUS even supports Boycott, Diverstment and Sanctions for Israel. The level of intimidation this can cause for Israeli students attending university in the UK is obvious.

At the NUS Women's conference 2015, proposals were put forward to replace clapping with jazz hands because of concerns that clapping would cause anxiety attacks. Additionally, gay men were accused of appropriating black female culture and a proposal was put forward to ban crossdressing.

Bahar Mustafa, a ""Welfare and Diversity officer"" that works for a student union, has even gotten away with [banning white people from an anti-racism event.](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/04/white-people-have-now-been-banned-from-an-anti-racism-event-at-a-british-university/)

The NUS uses it's power to censor it's political opponents, to intimidate right-leaning students and enforce it's narrative upon new students. It completely fails to represent students, yet at the national level there is no competitor to the NUS.

**Part 3: Lecturers and other university incidents**

[Read this blog post in its entirety.](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/05/if-youre-a-conservative-im-not-your-friend/)

If you were a conservative voter studying philosophy at Royal Holloway, there is massive incentive for you to hide your views because of the hateful political attitudes of one of the faculty. No doubt similar hateful attitudes are held silently by even more faculty. This isn't even a personal blog; it's an academic one.

It's so bad that I hide my political beliefs at my own university, and I would describe myself as a Centrist, not right-leaning.

There have been multiple incidents at British universities where Israeli students or speakers have faced intimidation. [Here's just one of them.](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/21/george-galloway-debate-israeli-oxford)

**Part 4: Why affirmative action is insufficient**

Affirmative action is supposed to be a last resort effort to increase inclusion after anti-discrimination measures have been tried. Unfortunately, there has been zero attempt to prevent political discrimination at university. If anything, it seems actively encouraged. Until that encouragement is ended and regular support avenues for non-left students are set up affirmative action will do nothing.

My personal recommendations for the UK:

* At a national level, set up a competitor to the NUS. There are a handful of student unions that have chosen to separate from the NUS due to it's radicalism that could work together to form this. It would be politically neutral.

* Prevent the NUS from enforcing censorship policies.

* Fire faculty and reprimand students who partake in or encourage discrimination towards anyone who is right-leaning.

* Crackdown on the currently legitimized and even supported Anti-Semetic and Anti-Israeli policies enacted at universities.

* Create a system by which students can report politicism, preferably at a level above universities instead of at the university itself because of the likelihood that such a system would be co-opted to deny right-leaning students access to it.

* Ensure that progenitors of Conservative ideology, such as Edmund Burke, are studied alongside the progenitors of Socialist ideology where relevant even prior to University level.

* Remove communist agitprop (such as ""An Inspector Calls"") from the English Literature GCSE.

If, after enacting all these policies and waiting 20 years, there is still a severe leftist slant in UK academia, then Affirmative Action would be worth considering as a last resort.","It's not just the Social Sciences that are dominated by the Left. The majority of *all* sciences skew towards the left rather than the right. 

I mean, the decision to be an academic has many qualities that appeal more to a Liberal than a Conservative.

1. For example, why would a highly educated and talented scientist rather work as a researcher post-doc with dismal pay, rather than find a high-paying industry job? Because he is less motivated by the size of the salary but more-so by the perceived value of the work he does. Certain kinds of people would rather do poorly paid University Research. Republicans are obsessed with minimizing taxes to maximize your personal income. Is it surprising that Republicans elect to take a higher paying industry job rather than stay in lower-paying academia? 


2. Moreover, graduate schools are dominated by foreign-born students coming to America as a pathway to citizenship. At my state university, the vast majority of grad-students were foreigners, and the faculty was too. Is it particularly surprising that a multicultural faculty is hostile towards US White Conservatism? Perhaps then the very reason why Academia is Left-dominated is precisely because of *diversity*. Of course professors will be angry at pro-white, anti-multiculturalist rants, when their demographics are much more multicultural than the larger US population!

As far as you know, most faculties may already have ideologically-based affirmative action programs in place. American universities are obviously not structurally homogeneous. Unfortunately, the talent pool of willing applicants may be so small that finding a qualified Conservative is nearly impossible. Just look at the stereotype of a Liberal arts graduate student! Do you really suppose a mainstream Conservative man will spend 5 years of his life on a PhD history thesis without salary? Will the typical Conservative stereotype elect to study the social sciences?


Finally, let's not forget the irony that affirmative-action-for-Republicans would fly against the face of Republican politics and ideology. Universities hire academics that can produce lots and lots of viable papers. Publish or perish. Moreover, Universities such as Harvard are private institutions that ""ought to"" do whatever the fuck they want. According to Republican political positions, ideologically-based affirmative action ought not be allowed. Positions should be given solely on merit - or in the Academic's case - their ability to generate vast amounts of research papers and bring prestige to the University. Conservatives should not be allowed into academia for the exact reason why Blacks or Latinos or other affirmative action'ed classes should not be allowed in - because they simply could not compete and do not have the necessary merit to be chosen.

Conservative professors should not be coddled by affirmative action, or they shall grow lazy and incompetent! ",293,"My answer will be from the perspective of a university student in the UK, so it might not apply directly to the US.

Low numbers of right-leaning students and faculty at universities is but a symptom of a far larger problem; Politicism or political discrimination. This is a problem that won't be solved by affirmative action because there are other disincentives for right-leaning people to express their views anywhere.

**Part 1: Politicism outside university**

Our recent general election, and the surprise Conservative victory, lead to an outpouring of hatred and discrimination directed at the Prime Minister, MPs and voters who 'voted wrong'. Not even one day had passed before it descended into violence in the streets of the capital.

There is a certain level of ""anti-right"" culture emerging in the West whereby the left believes that, because the right are so vile and evil, any level of silencing or hatred directed at the right is justified. Needless to say, the only place I really speak my mind on the subject of politics is anonymously online or with close family. A lot of other people have the same attitude. While I was initially hesitant to call this ""censorship"", based upon the left-wing concept of ""No Platform"" I do now genuinely believe this is censorship, in many cases deliberately done.

**Part 2: The Student Union**

In the UK, students are theortetically represented by the Student Union. At the national level, it is called the NUS (although not all student unions are affiliated with the NUS). This organization is so left-wing that even Maoists would call them loons. 

The NUS, not Universities themselves, [is the primary source of on-campus censorship in the UK.](http://www.spiked-online.com/free-speech-university-rankings/analysis#.VYd03PlVhBc) Pro-life groups are banned at 4 universities. Right-leaning newspaper ""The Sun"" is banned at 26 theoretically for having nude models on Page 3, yet effectively identical content is still available in other publications making the actual motive of censoring right-wing content completely transparent. 

The NUS even supports Boycott, Diverstment and Sanctions for Israel. The level of intimidation this can cause for Israeli students attending university in the UK is obvious.

At the NUS Women's conference 2015, proposals were put forward to replace clapping with jazz hands because of concerns that clapping would cause anxiety attacks. Additionally, gay men were accused of appropriating black female culture and a proposal was put forward to ban crossdressing.

Bahar Mustafa, a ""Welfare and Diversity officer"" that works for a student union, has even gotten away with [banning white people from an anti-racism event.](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/04/white-people-have-now-been-banned-from-an-anti-racism-event-at-a-british-university/)

The NUS uses it's power to censor it's political opponents, to intimidate right-leaning students and enforce it's narrative upon new students. It completely fails to represent students, yet at the national level there is no competitor to the NUS.

**Part 3: Lecturers and other university incidents**

[Read this blog post in its entirety.](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/05/if-youre-a-conservative-im-not-your-friend/)

If you were a conservative voter studying philosophy at Royal Holloway, there is massive incentive for you to hide your views because of the hateful political attitudes of one of the faculty. No doubt similar hateful attitudes are held silently by even more faculty. This isn't even a personal blog; it's an academic one.

It's so bad that I hide my political beliefs at my own university, and I would describe myself as a Centrist, not right-leaning.

There have been multiple incidents at British universities where Israeli students or speakers have faced intimidation. [Here's just one of them.](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/21/george-galloway-debate-israeli-oxford)

**Part 4: Why affirmative action is insufficient**

Affirmative action is supposed to be a last resort effort to increase inclusion after anti-discrimination measures have been tried. Unfortunately, there has been zero attempt to prevent political discrimination at university. If anything, it seems actively encouraged. Until that encouragement is ended and regular support avenues for non-left students are set up affirmative action will do nothing.

My personal recommendations for the UK:

* At a national level, set up a competitor to the NUS. There are a handful of student unions that have chosen to separate from the NUS due to it's radicalism that could work together to form this. It would be politically neutral.

* Prevent the NUS from enforcing censorship policies.

* Fire faculty and reprimand students who partake in or encourage discrimination towards anyone who is right-leaning.

* Crackdown on the currently legitimized and even supported Anti-Semetic and Anti-Israeli policies enacted at universities.

* Create a system by which students can report politicism, preferably at a level above universities instead of at the university itself because of the likelihood that such a system would be co-opted to deny right-leaning students access to it.

* Ensure that progenitors of Conservative ideology, such as Edmund Burke, are studied alongside the progenitors of Socialist ideology where relevant even prior to University level.

* Remove communist agitprop (such as ""An Inspector Calls"") from the English Literature GCSE.

"""Normal""

(adj.) Conforming to the standard or common type.

---

By the above definition, we can be sure that there is a 'Normal' human being. Or at the very least, various 'Normal' states to make up a 'Normal' human being.

Anything that is in the majority is a 'Normal' state. So, the 'Normal' human being is a Cisgendered, Heterosexual, Chinese man.

This means that states such as Transgender, Homosexual, Autistic etc. are not 'Normal'. They are in fact 'different'. and we desperately need to stop acting as if they are normal. They are different.

This does not mean they are worse, undesirable or negative. Nor does it mean they are better, desirable or positive. They are simply different.

"Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA+ friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never gone to one myself (always find out about it a few days after it happens), but I'm planning on going to volunteer at next year's Boston parade, assuming I'm home from school in time.

I personally get a little uncomfortable when I see straight people partying hard at Pride parades. To me, the parades are supposed to celebrate marginalized social groups who are often shoved under wave after wave of oppression and hatred the other 364 days of the year and has this one day to fully let loose and celebrate in the face of a culture who still may not accept them in the way that they'd like. When straight people jump in, it almost feels like they're co-opting the one day in which non-straight people are finally in control. It seems to me to be similar to straight people putting a rainbow filter over their profile pictures - in theory, it might be OK, but in practice it shifts the attention from the LGBTQA+ people who deserve it onto the straight person who steps in. Almost like a ""Look at me, I'm celebrating pride! Look at how great I am!""

And, yeah, to a certain extent I think this display of solidarity is good. Gay/trans/queer rights won't move forward without the support of those already in power - straight people - and it's nice to see people united across gender and sexuality boundaries in order to celebrate how far we've come and prepare for how far we still have to go. That being said, though, I think there's a point at which a display of solidarity becomes less about the people for whom the solidarity is shown and more about the people who are ""showing"" the solidarity. I think that at a certain point, support for the LGBTQA+ community can transition into an exercise in self-promotion and narcissism, and I'm not super comfortable with that.

This is why I think that straight/cis people who participate in Pride parades should spend some of that participation on volunteering. The parades really run on volunteers, and if a straight/cis person spends time doing the thankless task of picking up trash, filling and lugging big containers of water everywhere, or making sure a first-aid tent is properly staffed, it helps show support for the LGBTQA+ community in a way that simply taking selfies with a shirtless parader will never be able to. I think it's a great way to be an ally to the community in a way that doesn't obnoxiously trumpet that allyship, and it might teach people more about what really makes the revelry run smoothly and give them a new appreciation for something many almost take for granted.

tl;dr Volunteering is a helpful form of allyship for straight/cis people in a way that just going to the parade and celebrating is not.

**EDIT:** Just a clarification - I believe that people shouldn't be *forced* to volunteer, and going to the parade at all is still preferable by far to not going. That said, I think that going and volunteering is far enough preferable to just going to participate that it should be pretty heavily suggested for people planning to go.

"First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are devoted to saving the panda because pandas are extremely well known and popular, not because they have a good chance of survival.   Here are the reasons I believe this:
  
1) Pandas have lost much of their natural habitat due to the population explosion in China.  While this is regrettable, it is not likely to get fixed anytime soon. This means that even if we are able to revive this species they won't have anywhere to live.   
  
2) pandas, as a species, have chosen poorly. They are carnivorous animals who's main diet is bamboo. Their digestion can only process about 5% of the stuff in bamboo. That means they have to eat huge amounts of bamboo everyday. With the reduced habitat this is getting harder and harder. Either they need some microevolutionary shift to eat more nutritious sources of food orthey should join the likes of the dodo bird.   
  
3) human efforts to revive the population have shown some increases, but at what cost? It is incredibly difficult to get pandas to mate with one another, it's like they don't even want their species to survive. I get they aren't actually making this choice, this is just a facetious way of saying that their instincts and biology do not support the kind of growth in population hey need. Hell, half of their births are twins and the mother almost always lets one die because she doesn't produce enough milk. I realize this would take evolution to fix and this problem is way too short term, but it means that their survival requires an exorbanant amount of human intervention. Since their is a finite amount of resources conservationists can dedicate to endangered resources they are killing other more likely to survive species.  
  
4) I'm not saying we should encourage the decline of the panda. We should still try to preserve what habitat they have left and ban hunting them, but they are so far gone and require so much help that we shouldnt waste too many resources on them.

"Just as the title says, I firmly believe that the modern interpretation of the hipster does not truly exist and never has. I'm going to link an article from two years ago, and I'd appreciate it if you'd read it, [thanks!](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/opinion/sunday/caught-in-the-hipster-trap.html?_r=1)
If you've read that, you'll see all the contradictory things that make a hipster look like a hipster. Hipsters like old heritage looks, but they also like all contemporary clothing. Their footwear of choice are trainers, skate shoes, loafers, wingtips, sandals, and all manner of boots. Seems the only shoe that's off the list is a pair of stark black oxfords, but even then, I don't know. Hipsters like Apple products, but also love old technology! Their hobbies are anything outdoorsy or creative, except when they aren't I.E video games. They embrace both irony and sincerity ect., ect.,ect. It just seems like a strawman built up to shun anyone doing anything or acting in a certain way that you don't like. It also seems to be that the thing everyone hates about hipsters is their attitude, but deep down, it's an attitude anyone can have. It's an attitude of snobbishness and inauthenticity. I've mentioned this to a lot of people, I'd like to hear what others have to say, try changing my view!

"A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a Uzi submachine gun on full automatic.

From some comments various people have left on this and the reporting it seems that it is not unusual for kids even younger then that to shoot real firearms.

This is ridiculous. Children (and I define that in this case as everyone under 18) are not nearly responsible enough to handle them. There is a reason we do not let little children drive cars or drink alcohol etc.

Childrens Brains (and even young adult's, but you have to draw the line somewhere) are still in the process of developing. We all have done stupid shit as children. Hell, just here on reddit I read about some guy who shot his brother *twice* as a kid. You may choose not be believe that story, but for me it seems plausible.

I know btw that the Instructor in this case made some critical mistakes as well, and that children shooting firearms have to be supervised. But still, if the Girl had the experiance, wisdom and patience that comes with being an adult, this would have never happened. 

An adult acts as another layer of protection to prevent an accident. In my view, having a child handle a firearm is a little like not exercising proper trigger discipline. If you do everything else right, nothing bad can really happen. But you should never rely on doing everything else right.

You might know some very mature and patient 14 year old who is really interested in hunting or sport shooting. In that case, congratulations. But I still stand by my view that that kid should wait and grow four more years. Sure, they might not get to shoot for four your years, but nobody will die.

EDIT:

/u/caw81 has slightly changed my view. Now I think only people under the age of 16 should be barred.

EDIT 2:

/u/incruente and /u/Zorthianator have completely changed my view.

"If any of you frequent /r/badhistory, there is a rather infamous [chart](http://i.imgur.com/zbue8vU.jpg) that captures a popular perception of the Middle Ages as a ""dark age"" that retarded scientific progress by over 1,000 years. This perception is incorrect but is still commonplace. I believe that the Bush years will be viewed similarly by future generations for the following reasons:

The much disputed election in Florida was a huge challenge to the world's second-largest democracy. Having the Supreme Court effectively appoint a president upon party lines significantly hurt faith in the US political process and led to the polarization that has led to the Do-Nothing Congresses of 2006-2008 and 2010-.

Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq eroded the brief period of global consensus that saw countries from Iran to Russia united in sympathy with the USA against Al-Qaeda. I'm not saying we would be at world peace thereafter, but we could have taken advantage of that unity to seriously reduce international conflict.

Climate change. Need I say more? The Bush years saw inaction on global climate change that has endangered every country on earth.

Imperialism. The expansion of the War on Terror to Iraq and other groups was correlated with a rise of police militarization (in the US) and espionage (globally) and led to the installation of treasonous quisling governments around Europe.

Economic instability. The 2008 housing bubble (heavily concentrated in, you guessed it, Florida) triggered a global financial crisis that the world has yet to recover from. The progress that the world's 99%, overwhelmingly located in developing countries like China and India, made during the 2000s has almost completely been [reversed](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/timworstall/files/2015/01/oxfam1.jpg) by this fucking crisis. Global equity markets are now [as US-centric](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-map-of-the-world-if-size-was-determined-by-market-cap-2015-08-12) as they've ever been since at least the Eighties, meaning that ""the rise of the rest"" has been an utter illusion.

Erosion in quality of living. In addition to the phony ""development"" of countries like China and India, Western countries have seen a large absolute drop in well-being due to the financial crisis of the Bush years, a drop which treaties like TPP and TTIP may well enshrine into law.

TL;DR: If the world is a dystopia in 2200, George W. Bush will be (rightfully or not) blamed.

But, I think you are way overstating his influence.

**Bush v. Gore**
Yes, I think the Supremes blew it.  But it was in some ways a testament to our democracy that everyone accepted the process.  The peaceful transition of power, particularly in an unsatisfying way (and whichever way it went, half the country was going to be unsatisfied) is still relatively rare in the world.  I'm far more concerned about Citizens United or gutting the Voting Rights Act, which I think we have a much greater impact on elections and the governance than the Bush v. Gore where I can at least understand the votes.

**Squandered Opportunity for peace**  Agreed, we dropped the ball on this one.  But it wouldn't have stopped Russia's love of imperialism.  It wouldn't have stopped Muslim extremism in the Middle East.  Maybe an FDR could have forged something out of it - but Gore wasn't talented enough of a politician to create a coalition of nations dedicated to wiping out the poverty and ignorance that leads to extremism.  And it was early enough in his term that he wouldn't have the skills, relationships or staff capable of helping him accomplish this.

**Climate change** Congress was not going to pass legislation that would hobble the US economy for the sake of the future.  The threat isn't immediate enough (or perceived as certain enough by most people) for people to support the sort of extreme action that would be required.  Yes, Gore would have worked to reduce our speed in that direction, but he alone couldn't have made a significant enough difference.  He wasn't charismatic enough.  Plus, post 9/11, people would have had other priorities.

**Imperialism**.  Americans were scared shitless after 9/11.  Gore would have been forced to respond.  Likely, as a democrat, he's be under huge pressure to not ""be soft"" on terrorism.  I don't think he would have invaded Iraq, but probably would have done so in Afghanistan.  He would have also taken similar steps on domestic spying.  Remember, this is a guy whose wife lead the ""parental advisory warning on CD's"" movement - not a huge civil libertarian.

**Economic Instability** This can't all be pinned on Bush by a long shot.  [NPR did a great series](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money) on how the global economic boom created this unprecedented pile of money that needed to be invested somewhere, which lead to the popularity of ""mortgage-backed securities"", which lead to stupid loans, which lead to the global economic collapse.

There's no question that the amount of [disposable income in countries like China](http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/26/news/economy/china-middle-class/) has increased dramatically, and poverty has decreased.

Yes, the distribution of wealth is still screwed, but there is vastly more wealth, which is benefiting many poorer countries.

**TL;DR: it was a time of missed opportunities, and some screw ups, but I don't think it was a tipping point as you suggest, and that even had Gore been elected, things wouldn't have been dramatically different.**","&gt; The much disputed election in Florida was a huge challenge to the world's second-largest democracy. Having the Supreme Court effectively appoint a president upon party lines significantly hurt faith in the US political process and led to the polarization that has led to the Do-Nothing Congresses of 2006-2008 and 2010-.

Different methods of counting ballots led to different results.  The methods originally used by the state of Florida, the one proposed by Al Gore's campaign in his lawsuit, and the one used by the Supreme Court all tallied GWB as victor.  The one proposed by the Florida State Supreme Court had Al Gore winning.  I think a newspaper-sponsored recount after the fact (with another, different set of standards) also found that Al Gore got more votes.

Basically, it was a tie, and it turns out in that case the Supreme Court is the tiebreaker.

I'm not saying we would be at world peace thereafter, but we could have taken advantage of that unity to seriously reduce international conflict.

How?  When has something like that ever happened?  In reality, there was a large body of international opinion that the US should not even go into Afghanistan after Al Queda.  Many foreign governments were on board with it, but their peoples weren't.  If we'd never gone into Iraq all the same people would still hate us.

&gt; Climate change. Need I say more? The Bush years saw inaction on global climate change that has endangered every country on earth.

Do you seriously think Obama has made any serious progress on global climate change? How about Clinton?  If the US quit using coal tomorrow it would have no practical effect on climate change.  You need an international consensus and, obviously, electing Obama had no effect on that.

&gt; Imperialism. The expansion of the War on Terror to Iraq and other groups was correlated with a rise of police militarization (in the US) and espionage (globally) 

Correlation is not causation.  And if our espionage had been better we would never have gone to war in Iraq in the first place.

&gt; Economic instability. The 2008 housing bubble (heavily concentrated in, you guessed it, Florida) triggered a global financial crisis that the world has yet to recover from. 

Guess who forced mortgage giants to start using subprime mortgages in the first place?  Guess who kept Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from being audited in 2005?  Guess who's decided to still keep them alive today?  In all three cases, it was democrats, not GWB.

"Before you downvote me, please hear me out and try to CMV with a well articulated comment. I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting people up with downvotes.

I will try to explain my opinion.
WARNING: looong rant ahead.

I first watched Breaking Bad. 
I've never been into TV shows since they tend to be time consuming and (IMO) tend to appeal to a broader audience, but since everyone told me to watch it I did. 

There are definitely some high points in the show: Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Giancarlo Esposito gave terrific performances, and without them I think the show would not have had the success it had. 
Gus' arc is IMO the peak of the show, with Gus' back story and general awesomeness. 
The other characters though, feel irrelevant and without much to offer. There is the cop who conveniently discovers Heisenberg's identity on the toilet, his wife who is just... There, and the same goes for Walter's son. Skylar is a hypocrite and exists only to judge others from her morality horse. The other villains are forgettable and the psycho that appears towards the end of the show is a convenient plot device to kill Jesse's love interest and doesn't have any interesting trait. He's completely unidimensional. 
In the end, the series felt like an action movie with a few interesting characters and some pretty good cinematography, but nothing mind blowing. 

I still liked it though and I can see why people like it but if this is considered the best TV show ever, then I question TV shows' quality. 


Now for Game of Thrones: I didn't read the books nor do I intend to unless it's significantly better than the show. 

I will try to keep my cool but I really DESPISE this show. I feel about it the same way I feel about Attack On Titan (yes, I hate that one too): interesting premise, terrible characters and pacing, and lots of CHEAP. SHOCK. VALUE. 

The show always goes for the most shocking outcomes for the sake of shock value. People praise this show for being unpredictable and killing off anyone without distinction. Yet all the people who die are COMPLETE FUCKING IDIOTS and their deaths feel forced to avoid, god forbid, that the story might start getting going. 

When the Stark guy knows the King's wife has an incestous affair and suspects her to have tried to kill a fucking child, the guy who loves his wife tells him not to trust him and his daughter tells him about people wanting him DEAD he just claims the Iron Throne without considering that maybe, just MAYBE, he could get arrested/killed. 

He could singlehandedly fix the corruption of the South, or at least try to while others tried to kill him, but we can't have that, now can we? The story must keep not going anywhere. If his death could have been at least plausible then it would have been okay.

Then there is the dragon girl, who gets married to someone she doesn't love, is raped and then just falls in love with him. Dafuq, Stockholm's syndrome maybe?

And at the end of season 3 we have other Starks dying because they're complete fools. Marrying another woman when you have already promised to marry the daughter of a powerful ally sure is a bright move, Einstein! After that I just dropped the series.

It's just like a soap opera, with tons of violence and sex, where characters who are considered ""grey"" are just flat without any interesting development other than the dwarf (I don't even remember those guys names) and maybe the Stark tomboy little girl and the Stark who is at the Night Watch. There is a woman with an incestous affair with his pretty brother, a king who likes drinking, eating and fucking, a king who's a naive imbecile, a dragon girl with Stockholm's syndrome who becomes a badass cuz DRAGONS, a psychopathic teen king who somehow still hasn't died in 3 seasons, a guy whose penis makes the thinking and dooms his family to death, etc. 

THIS is considered good TV. If this is the best TV has to offer, then I don't even want to bother watching any more of it.

Please try to CMV.","You're missing the point of the shows you name to a certain extent. Breaking Bad isn't about exploring a wide cast of characters, it's about drilling down into the core of a select few characters with a primary focus on Walt. Characters like Hank, Marie, and Walt Jr. are really only relevant to the purpose of the show in how they affect Walt (I'd argue this is true about all characters besides Walt, but that's an argument for another time). 

Game of Thrones isn't about characters always doing the most intelligent, logical thing. If anything, it's the opposite: it's a study of the tragedies that inevitably follow from character traits (often traits that are usually seen as positive). Ned Stark's greatest fault is that he's so honest, honorable, and committed to doing his duty, he can't properly anticipate other people being treacherous and thus gets fooled and betrayed by basically everyone. Catelyn's defining trait, her desire to protect her family, leads her to make emotional choices that ultimately end up killing her husband and scattering her family. When characters aren't destroyed by their best qualities, they're torn apart time and time again by being forced to choose between two evils. 

Also, this show gets its reputation for surprising deaths due to its reliance on the viewer's awareness of narrative tropes. In a typical show, the Good Guy investigating corruption and doing the right thing would end up saving the day, or the Good King fighting a war against an unjust king would win and set the realm right. By instead showing the realistic consequences of the protagonists' actions, the show counters those implicit beliefs about how fiction should work and ends up surprising people. 

Finally, I wouldn't hold Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones up as examples of the best TV has to offer. It's certainly exciting to watch, but TV as a medium is unique because it gives the viewers the chance to get immersed in a world over a long span of time and become attached to characters over years. A TV show that makes optimal use of the advantages of the medium should offer a fully realized world with rich characters, while still creating a technically competent piece. Shows such as The Wire and Mad Men fit this mold better than shows like Breaking Bad (which has a narrower focus, though is still very good) and Game of Thrones (which often suffers from inconsistent quality and awkward dialogue). That said, if the character map of Game of Thrones is too much for you, then these kinds of shows may just not be your kind of thing. There's nothing wrong with that, but you're missing out on a rich viewing experience not possible in any other medium. ","While I will agree with you that both shows have their weaknesses, i'm not convinced, based on you viewpoint's defense, that you are up to speed on what these shows are trying to accomplish. 

I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that you are reasonably young. For some reason, a lot of younger TV and Movie watchers are becoming obsessed with plot mechanics. I cannot for the life of me figure out why. 'If X is happening to my character, and character does y, and it makes no sense to me, my appreciation for the tv show has fallen.'

 This is not what pop fiction is about. 

Breaking bad was a character study of evolution and morality, a study of actions and consequences, and responsibility. Drawing connections to reality, and watching good people make bad choices is the overall point of the show. Yet you did not indicate that you even grasped the concept, instead just pointed out plot holes/character confusion.

Game of thrones is even less plot centric. The plot isn't the focal piece (it's basically been done to death) it's the study of the characters/ ideologies. You reject their behaviors because they don't fit into what you consider correct behavior. Again, if you dislike the show for this reason, this defense is weak. Part of the strength of the show is learning and reflecting on why these people do the things they do, and why they act the way they act. You may not like the way they act. You may even say this makes the show 'less believable' at which point i tune you out (what part of anything on tv is even remotely believable).

The problem with movies like 'inception' (which i only moderately enjoyed) is that it makes a lot of people look at plot complexity and logic holes as the ultimate sign of 'story' quality, when there is no story in history that is regarded as classic or 'art' because of it's plot logic. It's the other stuff that you take with you that makes it longer lasting and enduring and elevates it to a new level.",300,"While I will agree with you that both shows have their weaknesses, i'm not convinced, based on you viewpoint's defense, that you are up to speed on what these shows are trying to accomplish.

It's the other stuff that you take with you that makes it longer lasting and enduring and elevates it to a new level.","You're missing the point of the shows you name to a certain extent. Breaking Bad isn't about exploring a wide cast of characters, it's about drilling down into the core of a select few characters with a primary focus on Walt. Characters like Hank, Marie, and Walt Jr. are really only relevant to the purpose of the show in how they affect Walt (I'd argue this is true about all characters besides Walt, but that's an argument for another time). 

Game of Thrones isn't about characters always doing the most intelligent, logical thing. If anything, it's the opposite: it's a study of the tragedies that inevitably follow from character traits (often traits that are usually seen as positive). Ned Stark's greatest fault is that he's so honest, honorable, and committed to doing his duty, he can't properly anticipate other people being treacherous and thus gets fooled and betrayed by basically everyone. Catelyn's defining trait, her desire to protect her family, leads her to make emotional choices that ultimately end up killing her husband and scattering her family. When characters aren't destroyed by their best qualities, they're torn apart time and time again by being forced to choose between two evils. 

Also, this show gets its reputation for surprising deaths due to its reliance on the viewer's awareness of narrative tropes. In a typical show, the Good Guy investigating corruption and doing the right thing would end up saving the day, or the Good King fighting a war against an unjust king would win and set the realm right. By instead showing the realistic consequences of the protagonists' actions, the show counters those implicit beliefs about how fiction should work and ends up surprising people. 

Finally, I wouldn't hold Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones up as examples of the best TV has to offer. It's certainly exciting to watch, but TV as a medium is unique because it gives the viewers the chance to get immersed in a world over a long span of time and become attached to characters over years. A TV show that makes optimal use of the advantages of the medium should offer a fully realized world with rich characters, while still creating a technically competent piece. Shows such as The Wire and Mad Men fit this mold better than shows like Breaking Bad (which has a narrower focus, though is still very good) and Game of Thrones (which often suffers from inconsistent quality and awkward dialogue).

"Although I'm conflicted about all aspects of Justice, Inc., I would be happy to see [this kid](http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/23/8648851/swatting-doxing-legal-case-canada-online-harassment) rot in a cell for decades.

Making examples of people like this is the only deterrent I can think of for /b/tards who think terrorizing people, risking lives, and draining public resources for no reason is harmless and hilarious.

It's hard for me to feel much sympathy when their /b/tard lives are permanently ruined, since they're practically never held accountable.

Am I being a dick about this? Are you sure?","I just finished a Law test which included sentencing, so I could shed some light on why it is a bad idea.

I'm no expert on the crime specifically, but I'll start by discussing deterrence as a sentencing rationale. 

Deterrence, for anyone who can't figure it out, is punishing more than someone deserves as a means of scaring others into not committing the crime. It is a good method, as huge punishments for petty crime generally do deter people from committing it (to an extent). However it is extremely unjust to give huge punishments for petty crime, because (in reference to your suggestion) you are giving them a sentence length equivalent to violent crime and even murder. If you can achieve deterrence then it is obviously a positive, as less people are going to commit the crime. But there are many problems with it, which is why it is almost never used and when it is used, it gets a negative backlash (Look at the war on drugs, mandatory minimum sentences etc). 

It assumes many things - that the criminal expects to get caught, that the authorities actually catch these people often. If the apprehension rate is low, which it is for this crime, then people aren't going to be scared of getting caught and the punishment won't matter. It also requires good publication of the sentences given, because if people don't know the punishment given out in practice then they won't care. It also arbitrarily punishes someone more than they deserve, which goes against many sentencing principles in western criminal justice systems. This is more for violent crime, but people usually weigh the severity of the crime over the length - so a harsher punishment will be better than a longer one. 

The biggest factor is that they don't expect to get caught, which makes the punishment irrelevant. 

Individual rights are hugely important here too. I'll discuss a few of the relevant criminal justice system principles which are consistent across western societies.

* The principle of minimum criminal punishments. This ties in with the idea that penal punishments should be avoided if possible, because jail heavily restricts established individual liberties. Deterrence goes against this entirely, as you are extending the restrictions on ones liberties based off of actions that others could commit. You are essentially taking punishment for what others haven't even done yet, which is bad policy. 

* Proportionality - the punishment should fit the crime. Years of jail time are far more (Taking into account restriction of personal liberties) than this crime generally deserves. 

Finally, it is worth mentioning that courts do take into account aggravating and mitigating factors on a case by case basis. If Swatting resulted in injury, an unusually large amount of resources being wasted or unusually large amounts of psychological damage then they would aggravate the sentence.

If there are many crimes being committed at once when swatting then it could make for a big punishment. This is why some IT crimes can amount to huge sentences in comparison to something which is seemingly worse, like murder. The IT crimes are usually many crimes being committed together, where as murder is the singular sentence. 

**tl;dr** - Deterrence doesn't really work. It relies on the fact that people expect to get caught, which they don't. It also violates many sentencing principles. ","The kid you've linked to in that news article is 17 right now. You're saying he should face decades of imprisonment for what he's done... now think about that, really. We throw around punishment very severely in our society, but really think about what you're saying.

He'll have never finished school, gotten any job experience, he's already got this criminal record, he'll be getting into his older years so finding companionship will be much more difficult...

"To me, online entertainment is such a flip of a coin. You either get a partnership or you don't, and even if you do get the partnership, there's no saying that what you make will be enough to live off of, so it's probably just safer to get a real job.

For Youtube, it seems like you need to be the following to be successful:

* A young attractive person (or at least a person with an attractive voice) that appeals to some major demographic (teenage girls, LGBT teens, sports fans, etc.)

* Someone who was already famous on a different social medium

* A Let's Player

And in all of these, you need a certain budget to spend on making your videos (light, camera, a crew maybe?) and that's not including the money you need for specific videos (e.g. a Let's Player needs enough money to buy new/big budget games in order to attract attention, a make-up channel needs to buy TONS of products, clothing channels need to shop on a regular basis, etc.).

Twitch has the same problems as a Youtube Let's Player; in order to be noticed, you need to buy really popular games and/or new games, and those are rarely cheap; most games are up in the $60+ range, not including DLC or even the equipment needed to stream at a constant frame-rate for long periods of time. 

Even if you DO get popular on either of these platforms and get a partnership, Twitch takes half of your subscription profits, leaving you mostly depending on possible donations, and Youtube takes a lot of your ad revenue (not including other Youtube-related partnerships you might have [cough cough Nintendo cough]). 

If you ABSOLUTELY need to make money on one of these platforms, or a similar platform, then you should either be rich or have had a real job long enough that you have enough money to survive.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","This is very much like a career in acting. You could say: well only a lucky few get to perform in movies. But the truth is, luck often has very little to do with it.

1: You most certainly do not need to be an attractive person to get an audience. Sure, it might help a bit, but there are plenty of examples which say otherwise. Take for example boogie2988. He is a big overweight person with 2.5 million subscribers. He is a lot of things, but I do not think his viewerbase thinks he is attractive on the appearance side of things.

2: Neither is it important to be famous from other media. Sure it helps out greatly, but it is no more than a kickstart. The real reason for their career lies in something else, which I shal expend on in the final paragraphs. Take for example again boogie2988, or as a fresh example lindsey stirling. Lindsey Stirling is a musician, who became famous through youtube. She made some excellent music, and gained a fair share of subscribers. She became famous because someone entered her in the King of the web contest, and she went from a youtube musician to someone touring all over the world. Marketing and skill are key.

3: While let's players have an easier time, because half of the content is made for them, there are plenty of other examples of people who became big without let's plays. In the top 100 youtube subscriber list, there are plenty of examples. Many music channel, or things like epic mealtime, prankvsprank or ERB (epic rap battles).


So let's start talking about what made them succesfull in the first place. There are 3 big things which in my opinion get you a career in youtube/streaming

1: skill. The same reason why professional sports is one of the most watched media. The ability to do what millions of others cannot. The reason why so many league of legend channels are so big, is because the game has a large playerbase, and those players love watching the absolute top. It may not always be able to achieve this for everyone, but let me say that the top 50 Starcraft 2 players practise a lot.

2: following up on that is the most important section: dedication. Starting a channel or stream takes a lot of time. The mistake many people make is that they stream for maximum 2 hours, finally have 3 viewers and stop streaming. People attract people, and even the bigger streamers don´t achieve their mx viewers until hours after starting.

This also goes for youtube. If you can only post 1 quality video every 2 weeks, you channel is not interesting enough. The ability to be a consistant source of entertainment is important. Lethalfrag is an example of someone who made it into streaming. He saved his money so he didnt need income for a year, and went all/out streaming. He started from nothing, but since he was entertaining and going the entire year, he achieved his goal, and could sustain himself. Boogie2988 has been youtubing for over 9 years now, he never gave up on the early hurdles.

3: charismatic. Just like acting you need some skills. Give viewers a good reason to watch you over those other 200 channels. Although not my taste, a channel like pewdiepie knows what fanbase he has, and how to entertain them. stand out from others.

so to conclude. Yes, making money (enough to sustain yourself) only happens to a few. But those are not the lucky few, those are the people with the dedication (mostly) and skill (secondary) to really go for it. It is a lot like acting. Sure getting a real job is safer, but your work is more than just income. I rather be barely surviving doing the thing i love, than being filthy rich and doing what i hate for 9 hours a day.","As is said about the game development community sometimes, ""Passion is cheap in this industry.""  No one's putting up a 'Help Needed: Play video games and ad lib for a living, starting salary $60k'.

So yeah - the competition is rough, I would imagine.  And while luck, like in any entertainment industry, is a factor, I think it's only a portion of it.  For one, you just have to *be entertaining*.  That's something you can learn to an extent, but a lot of it is just your personality.  You gotta be funny, you gotta be creative, you gotta be able to offer something that the million other people that would like to be able to do the same thing can't offer.

The other thing is you gotta be on your grind day after day.  Even if you have the goods you gotta out there and that takes time.

Imagine a schizophrenic telling you about his condition and you responding by, yeah, I know what you mean, I drink a lot. 

It totally absolves any responsibility by calling it a disease and is offensive to anyone with a real disease that they can't fix by just doing less of something destructive.

Addictions have symptoms, like cravings, and withdrawal. Withdrawal can last a ridiculously long time, and can have many detrimental effects. Chemical dependencies are particularly rough for this. You seem to misunderstand how the brain works a bit. It's not like ""oh, I apologize too much, I gotta remind myself not to apologize as frequently"" habit. It's a thing your brain thinks you **need** and will respond as though something has gone very drastically if it thinks its not getting the thing it needs.","There are a few issues here. Firstly there are two main kinds of addiction, psychological and physiological. Psychological addiction is the brain saying ""dude you need this, go get it"", a little like an incredibly strong habit. People with a psychological addiction may suffer withdrawal symptoms, but they are purely psychosomatic. Physiological addiction however is different. It will only occur with certain substances, but once the physiological addiction sets in the body quickly becomes dependant upon the substance, no longer able to function properly without it. Take away the substance and the withdrawal is pretty horrific, seizures, blacking out, sometimes comas or even death in extreme cases.

In both cases once the addiction has set in it is at best difficult and at worst impossible to break the addiction without medical treatment. To call it a disease is a misnomer, but to call it a habit is even less accurate.

As for your first sentence, I consider it wrong on both counts. Firstly because most diseases do disappear quickly with no apparent reason, the person just got better. Secondly (depending on where we draw the line of what is and isn't addiction) breaking an addiction generally requires some form of treatment, albeit not treatment in the same sense that most see it but something more akin to many treatments for mental health issues, though strong physiological addictions do often require drugs and other medical attention.",303,"There are a few issues here.

In both cases once the addiction has set in it is at best difficult and at worst impossible to break the addiction without medical treatment. To call it a disease is a misnomer, but to call it a habit is even less accurate.

As for your first sentence, I consider it wrong on both counts. Firstly because most diseases do disappear quickly with no apparent reason, the person just got better. Secondly (depending on where we draw the line of what is and isn't addiction) breaking an addiction generally requires some form of treatment, albeit not treatment in the same sense that most see it but something more akin to many treatments for mental health issues, though strong physiological addictions do often require drugs and other medical attention.","Well, its both, and there are different kinds of addiction. Addictions have symptoms, like cravings, and withdrawal. Withdrawal can last a ridiculously long time, and can have many detrimental effects. Chemical dependencies are particularly rough for this. You seem to misunderstand how the brain works a bit. It's not like ""oh, I apologize too much, I gotta remind myself not to apologize as frequently"" habit. It's a thing your brain thinks you **need** and will respond as though something has gone very drastically if it thinks its not getting the thing it needs.",r2,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.6,0.5,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.3,0.6,0.5,0.4,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.2,r1,,
"I am a husband and father of two. I love my wife, and I love my children, but I am not a fan of Father's Day. I feel the ""holiday"", if one can call it that, forces people to adopt a tradition that bills itself very similarly to a birthday...which I already have once a year. If you want to appreciate someone it should be done on an individual basis and *not* based on some yearly Hallmark Holiday. Yes, I feel the same about Mother's Day, but I'll be damned if I don't go through the motions.  

I feel much the same way about many of the other ""appreciation days"" (e.g. Administrative Professionals Day, Thank a Mailman Day, etc.). You are thanking someone for doing what they *chose* to do. Society should not force an expectation on others to give you praise for the things you choose to do or become.

Why celebrate someone's birthday? It's really just an arbitrary marker that bears little on an individual's actual development. Christmas is a scam. Halloween is a scam. Easter (if you're not religious) is a scam. Mother's day: scam. On and on.

But you know what? I like these days, I don't care if they were pushed into being by cold and uncaring corporations. They are a part of our culture, and we chose to make that so. 

You could say that companies were just responding to a need (days of celebration) evidenced by how well they were received and embedded into the fabric of our culture. There are many 'holidays' you've never heard of, because they were never accepted by the public at large. The ones we celebrate, we celebrate for a reason.

Ignoring the consumerism for a moment, what I find important about these days is it does give you time to reflect. Mother's Day makes us ask ourselves ""Have I been showing my mom how much I love her?"" In the day to day hustle of life, it's easy to lose track of these things. Ideally, we'd never need a day, we'd just be thankful and appreciative all year round. But we tend to be focused on our own needs most of the time. Father's Day helps raise our awareness about what it means to be a good dad, or a good son or daughter for that dad.

I'm not going to try convincing you to love Father's Day, but I would urge you not to ""hate"" it. My dad actually sounds quite a bit like you, and honestly it saddens me the way he is. He is so hyper aware of social manipulation of this kind that he loses perspective. He takes on a cynical attitude towards these trappings and so becomes less emotionally receptive as a result. He thinks he's rebelling against culture, but really, he's just rebelling against his own family, closing off one small avenue to help strengthen bonds.

In the end, he accomplishes nothing with his rebellion in terms of reshaping culture, and ultimately starts to seem more a curmudgeon than anything. Being in such vehement opposition to something as trivial as a holiday doesn't make you brave or heroic, it just makes you an ass (not saying this about you personally, just in general). 

Your view of the world shapes reality. If you see Father's Day as consumerist bullshit, that is exactly what it will be for you. You will act in such a manner as to make it so. It's very easy to pick up on the vibe of your parents and respond in kind. Your kids could have had an opportunity to be extra loving on this day with you, and you could respond in turn. But alas, you are simply too above it. Too above a good excuse to be a bit kinder to each other. Is that really something worth fighting for? Is that the person you want to be? Is that how you want your kids to be?

Just try this. Be stupid for a day. On Father's Day, take it just as seriously as marketers would like you to. Get excited about all the gestures of kindness, material or otherwise, and make your appreciation clear to your family. You will be surprised to discover, that forced excitement and appreciation becomes real. What was before only a formality, becomes a catalyst for real emotional connection. When your family sees your warm reception, it will make them happy, which in turn will make you happy. Instead of reinforcing a cycle of cynicism, you are now reinforcing a cycle of love and kindness. Does it actually really matter how the day came about? You have an opportunity here, fucking *use it*.

Life may ultimately be meaningless, but each day we have the ability to create real meaning for ourselves, our friends, and our family. Father's Day may be bullshit, but it also represents one small opportunity to find true meaning. Not just find it, but to make it. To fail to understand this is to fail to make the best use of this short time we have.

"I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununpentium) or [ununtrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununtrium), I got the feeling that it's almost cheating to call these things elements and add them to the periodic table.

The atoms are created in a lab, usually by slamming two other heavy atoms together in a collider. The resulting atom decays in microseconds and does not naturally occur outside the lab.

Calling these things new elements strikes me as the same thing as grabbing two random objects, (say a water bottle and a book), holding them together in your hands and saying, ""Look! I've created a bookbottle!""

The object will only last until you let go of it, and then be torn apart by the stronger force, in this case, gravity. It's not a new tool or object and you can't file a patent for it.

Ununpentium and its ilk are not elements if they can't be found outside the lab, cannot exist as more than a few atoms at a time, or last more than a few microseconds. They are interesting experiments to be sure, but they are not new elements.

Change my view.


EDIT:

Wow, I really didn't see how many gaping holes my argument had. 

What I've learned:

&gt;Short half life

It's short by our human standards, but that means nothing on the universal scale. Our lives are nothing on the scale of the universe, that doesn't mean we aren't alive.

&gt;Very few atoms at a time

This is just a limit on what we're able to synthesize. Massive quantities could theoretically be created in a supernova.

&gt;Not outside the lab.

Where it is synthesized doesn't matter. The lab is still in the universe, so it could be said that the universe is creating these atoms.

There are lots of convincing arguments here, and I'll respond to all of them and delta the ones I feel really swayed me.

&gt;&gt;""I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.""

So, ruling out the unlikely extremes, we can imagine that the vast majority of them would grow up to be ""regular"" or ""average"" people, correct? 

Average people grow, explore, discover, make friends, they create, they produce, they share, they connect, they bond, they feel and illicit feeling. They have families, they make families, they love and they are loved. Assuming you don't come from a family of exclusively ""geniuses, and great innovators"" or ""Unabombers and sociopaths"", presumably you are, and are surrounded by fairly average people. How do you measure their value? If one were to get incredibly ill, and was unable to pay for the entirety of their care, would you consider them an unwarranted cost on society? Ought they simply be left to die for the greater good? What if it were your young son? 

You have to understand that when discussing matters of life and death, money is not the correct language. The value of human life cannot be measured in dollars. It is measured in emotion, love, connections, influence...

Have you never been impacted by another human being? How can you measure the impact and importance of a kind, positive person. That individual will walk through their life leaving positive impressions and effects all around them - like a wake behind a boat, rippling out and out, influencing the next person and the next, who then turns around and continues that outward spread. Have you never been effected by a warm smile, or a bit of small-talk?

Clearly, I disagree with the entire premise of your argument. I think it shows a profound lack of empathy, or better yet, any actual understanding of life and humanity. However, let's go on and debate this on your own terms. 

You say that the cost of caring for these sick kids isn't justified by the potential of their being great successes, simply because the odds of that happening are too slim. 

&gt;&gt;"" I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump.""

You are right that the odds are slim, however you are wrong to say that therefore ""the argument falls apart when we look at expected returns."" Let's use your Einstein example. How does one quantify the monetary worth of a great scientist? Let's imagine that we had never had the contributions of Watson &amp; Crick. Without the discovery and understanding of DNA, where would modern medicine stand today? Is caring for 100 thousand ""average"" sick kids worth the preservation of 1 Watson &amp; Crick equivalent? I would certainly say so. 

Let's look at a businessman like Steve Jobs. How much wealth did he create in his lifetime? How many billions and billions of dollars were generated in the development, production, distribution and sales of his products? You say, ""he's 1 in a million,"" right? Well, let's imagine he's generated 10 billion dollars of wealth in his lifetime (rather conservative). Him being 1 in a million means that we could spend 1,000 dollars on each and every one of the other 999,000 individuals and we'd only just then reach his worth. Moreover, that's assuming that the other 999,000 people contributed *absolutely zero value over their entire lives*. 

The other problem with your argument is that you seem to believe that great people exist in vacuums. Perhaps the sick kid you save is our next great scientist's little cousin. Perhaps his or her little cousin's perseverance, strength, or tragic death, has motivated and inspired our future scientist to do great things. Perhaps this sick child lives long enough to make friends in school. Perhaps he or she loves science fiction books and movies, and that interest rubs off on one of his/her friends who otherwise wouldn't have picked up this interest at such a young age. Perhaps that nascent interest in the wonders of science and its possibilities was *invaluable* in the formation of our next great scientist. 

The bottom line is, trying to place a dollar amount on the value of a human life is hopeless. We exist in infinitely complex social environments, and even ""average"" people can be instrumental in the generation of massive, valuable changes in the world. 

All that aside, we preserve the lives of ill children (or of any age), because someone loves them. They don't want to lose them. There is no dollar amount one can place on that. ","All of your points are rooted in a broadly utilitarian philosophy, which holds that whichever action increases utility is the morally correct one to make - in the case of your argument, it is mainly economic utility. It fails to take into account a number of things. Firstly, there is another definition of 'utility' - the maximisation of pleasure. Letting sick children die is an exercise in cold pragmatism, and not an action (or consequence of deliberate inaction, more specifically) that anyone would relish or enjoy. There is undeniable value in allowing and encouraging a society to feel good about itself, and failure to take that into account would result in a society that has less esteem in itself, and therefore a society that functions less efficiently, and is more likely to descend into dysfunction. Indeed, Jeremy Bentham, considered the founder of modern utilitarianism, said that, ""it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong"". And while your suggestions would probably provide a small economic boost, this does not make up for the inevitable loss of happiness that such actions would cause.

To look outside of utilitarian philosophy, I would also hold that your suggestion runs contrary to the entire point of government, which is look after its citizens, to safeguard their lives and livelihoods. A government should - and most, thankfully, do, to at least some extent - look after the needs of its most vulnerable citizens, *regardless of whether or not this is of any economic benefit*. Taking a ruthlessly pragmatic approach to the lives and well-being of the citizens in their care is not the mark of a functional government trying to foster a stable society, but of a government trying to trim society down to its bare, self-sustainable bones - in other words, not a government trying to its best for the people, but a government trying to make itself obsolete in one of the most brutal ways possible. 

As for your Malthusian argument, I think the number of sick children being kept alive in the ways you describe is low enough to have a negligible effect on the total human population. ",307,"You're treating life as if its ""value"" were easily quantifiable. 

&gt;&gt;""I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.""

So, ruling out the unlikely extremes, we can imagine that the vast majority of them would grow up to be ""regular"" or ""average"" people, correct? 

Average people grow, explore, discover, make friends, they create, they produce, they share, they connect, they bond, they feel and illicit feeling. They have families, they make families, they love and they are loved. Assuming you don't come from a family of exclusively ""geniuses, and great innovators"" or ""Unabombers and sociopaths"", presumably you are, and are surrounded by fairly average people. How do you measure their value? If one were to get incredibly ill, and was unable to pay for the entirety of their care, would you consider them an unwarranted cost on society? Ought they simply be left to die for the greater good? What if it were your young son? 

You have to understand that when discussing matters of life and death, money is not the correct language. The value of human life cannot be measured in dollars. It is measured in emotion, love, connections, influence...

Have you never been impacted by another human being? How can you measure the impact and importance of a kind, positive person. That individual will walk through their life leaving positive impressions and effects all around them - like a wake behind a boat, rippling out and out, influencing the next person and the next, who then turns around and continues that outward spread. Have you never been effected by a warm smile, or a bit of small-talk?

Clearly, I disagree with the entire premise of your argument. I think it shows a profound lack of empathy, or better yet, any actual understanding of life and humanity. However, let's go on and debate this on your own terms. 

You say that the cost of caring for these sick kids isn't justified by the potential of their being great successes, simply because the odds of that happening are too slim. 

&gt;&gt;"" I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump.""

You are right that the odds are slim, however you are wrong to say that therefore ""the argument falls apart when we look at expected returns."" Let's use your Einstein example. How does one quantify the monetary worth of a great scientist? Let's imagine that we had never had the contributions of Watson &amp; Crick. Without the discovery and understanding of DNA, where would modern medicine stand today? Is caring for 100 thousand ""average"" sick kids worth the preservation of 1 Watson &amp; Crick equivalent? I would certainly say so. 

Let's look at a businessman like Steve Jobs. How much wealth did he create in his lifetime? How many billions and billions of dollars were generated in the development, production, distribution and sales of his products? You say, ""he's 1 in a million,"" right? Well, let's imagine he's generated 10 billion dollars of wealth in his lifetime (rather conservative). Him being 1 in a million means that we could spend 1,000 dollars on each and every one of the other 999,000 individuals and we'd only just then reach his worth. Moreover, that's assuming that the other 999,000 people contributed *absolutely zero value over their entire lives*. 

The other problem with your argument is that you seem to believe that great people exist in vacuums. Perhaps the sick kid you save is our next great scientist's little cousin. Perhaps his or her little cousin's perseverance, strength, or tragic death, has motivated and inspired our future scientist to do great things. Perhaps this sick child lives long enough to make friends in school. Perhaps he or she loves science fiction books and movies, and that interest rubs off on one of his/her friends who otherwise wouldn't have picked up this interest at such a young age. Perhaps that nascent interest in the wonders of science and its possibilities was *invaluable* in the formation of our next great scientist. 

The bottom line is, trying to place a dollar amount on the value of a human life is hopeless. We exist in infinitely complex social environments, and even ""average"" people can be instrumental in the generation of massive, valuable changes in the world. 

All that aside, we preserve the lives of ill children (or of any age), because someone loves them. They don't want to lose them. There is no dollar amount one can place on that.

"Today, talking on WhatsApp with someone new I just met a couple of days ago I realized that chatting is not the same nowadays than 5~ years ago where people sat down in their computers on MSN or stopped anything they were doing to actually talk to someone else, now it's like you need to try very hard to get the attention of someone because people are usually entertained with something else happening in their daily lives and they turn to their phone's or change to their browser tabs where the chat is going on every time they had a chance. Or when they want to because now we can decide to ignore you or not thanks to notifications. 

The thing is that I now see texting only like a fast way to just deliver a message or arrange something and not as a mean to talk with someone just for the sake of talking, or like meeting someone new because that feel of attention you get when directly talking to someone's ear is simply not there.

I prefer way more to do a phone call or talk face to face when I really feel like talking with someone.

"Being transgender and wanting surgery/hormonal treatment is being so uncomfortable with yourself as a person that you need invasive surgery, or completely body-altering hormonal treatment to feel comfortable. I think that the only reason we don't define it as that is political correctness, combined with the stigma around mental illness. Transgender people don't want to be lumped in with other people with mental illnesses because there is a such a stigma against it. And if society starts treating transgender people as having no mental issue, and accepting invasive surgery as the standard treatment then that will slow research towards less drastic treatments.

Ideally, in the future, if someone were to come into a doctor's office and say ""I feel so bad in my current body that I want hormonal treatment and invasive surgery"" the doctor would be able to prescribe something that would just make the transgender person no longer feel terrible in their current body.

The DSM (used in the US) recently declassified us as a 'disorder', but the ICD (used in much of the rest of the world) continues to classify us as a paraphilic disorder (essentially, a fetish). It's worth pointing out, however, that the ICD didn't declassify homosexuality as a disorder until the 90s (in fact, they did so in the current version of the ICD), two decades after the DSM declassified it. It also classifies the vast majority of the population as sex disordered, since things like enjoying kinky sex are disordered by the ICD's standards. The current draft of the upcoming new ICD edition also declassifies us as mentally ill, following the DSM's example.

But I would say we are not disordered, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.

Moreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are [much more likely](http://books.google.com/books?id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=PCOS+and+transgenderism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDzI2rtV5S&amp;sig=EMQL22TzAMnQ2nNSZV1LfuE2djM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cDd-U_b7I8SXqAaiiIK4CA&amp;ved=0CIYBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=PCOS%20and%20transgenderism&amp;f=false) to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that [single cases](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9624-1) merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.

There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, [David Reimer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named [Norah Vincent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norah_Vincent) spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she *checked herself into a mental institution* because she was worried she might harm herself.

------------------------------

Additionally, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical/political reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

Compare this with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part.

What about intersex people? People born physically not clearly male or female, what would you adjust their minds to and why?

You see, gender is something defined by your brain.

It's that way for cis, trans and intersexual people.

Surely, I think it's wrong and absolutely fatal to take an intersexual infant or child and simply modify their bodies to ""match with standards"" as you have no way to know whether they're male or female gendered.

Say you have an intersexual infant that is male gendered (but you can't know that) and turn them physically female. When they grow up they'll have so much mental suffering because of what was done to them.

In the past it was believed that gender is a social construct and that your body and society defines your gender. Which is why so many intersexual infants have simply been mutilated (yes, it's a mutilation) and turned into a female (well, only physically anyway).

Same happened to male infants that had a failed circumcision or were simply born with a micro penis. Doctors believed that simply permanently changing their bodies to a female would be better for them than living as a male with a damaged or small penis.

It's like taking a cis/intersex person and making them trans. Which is horrible.

A lot of those people later on have spoken up and said what horrible thing was done to them. It showed that gender is something in your brain that you're born with and not something defined by your body.

Some of those people ended up committing suicide because of what was done to them.

Transition for trans people on the other hand, is like the opposite of the above. It's to alter the body to be in accordance with one's gender (one's mind).

If you, the reader, happens to be a cis male, just look down and think: Do you like your penis? Of course you do. Would you want it to be cut away? Of course not. But why? Well, that's because your brain is programmed that way. Ever wondered why girls are fine with having no penis and males are fine with having one?

For either gender, just look down and think having the wrong bits between your legs. Not such a nice imagination, right?

Imagine getting up tomorrow and suddenly being trapped in the wrong body. Imagine having the wrong bits down there, Imagine having the wrong face, the wrong voice and just the complete body is wrong.

It's the suffering trans people go through every day.

And, the way you're programmed is connected to your gender, your personality and your entire identity, which is why changing your body is less invasive than changing who you are.

So, if you were to get up in the wrong body tomorrow and there was such a pill to change your brain. Would you rather take such a pill, change your whole identity and the way you feel and struggle everyday thinking that ""once it was different"", ""this is not right"" or would you rather go trough the process of getting hormonal treatment, surgery and adjust your body to match who you truly are? Which one sounds more fulfilling and correct?

And even if you would decide to take that pill, and you would be physically and mentally the opposite sex of what you used to be, remember that you don't have any experience in that gender. You'd only know how it used to be and it would be a shock. It just doesn't seem right, does it?

A trans person's mind on the other hand has always been the way it is.

Gender is something in your brain that you're born with.

Changing one's body to the opposite of one's mind is absolutely terrible, just as is leaving a person born in the wrong body with the body they have.

"I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty!

Let's start with why I find eating meat at all to be morally justifiable. I only buy meat from free-roam organic farms, which are clearly labeled here in Denmark. If I eat one of the cows I see on the outskirts of my city, happily roaming and eating grass, I don't really feel guilty. They get to experience a reasonably long, happy and healthy life. We also have pigs that are allowed to roam free in the forest. We give them a safe environment, and their lives end up on average longer and happier than they would be in the wild.

So imagine if an alien species came to earth and says: *""Hey, we'll create a post-scarcity society for you. All your life you will be in perfect health. You (as in all humans) will never want for anything, you will get all your favorite food and you get to play video games all day or whatever it is you want to do. But when you reach the age of 50, we will kill you in a humane way and then we will eat your corpse.""* I would find that to be a good deal. It would remove world hunger, there is no need to fight for resources. No diseases killing young people, no genetic defects. Not even having to work or do anything you don't want. And you would still get a reasonably long life to enjoy.

And now we get to lamb meat. These guys are killed at 1 month to 1 year, which is in the best case less then 1/10th of their lives. They don't get to enjoy their lives. In my alien analogy, it would be like making the deal ""Yeah some of you get to live until 50, but some of you we will take and eat at 5"", which suddenly becomes less acceptable.

**What would change my view:**

* Somehow making my alien analogy work for eating humans at 5

* Giving me another compelling moral argument for why eating lamb meat is ok.

**What will NOT change my view:**

* The ""Animals are made for human consumption so they don't matter"" argument. Well yes, but they are also intelligent agents capable of feeling pain and suffering. An alien species with superior technology and intelligence could decide that ""Humans are made for alien consumption"", and enslave our species, keeping us in cages all our lives. That would be horrible. So even if they are less intelligent and feel suffering differently, it does not give us the right to harm them for no good reason. We as a species get to decide which animals are for human consumption and which aren't, and what conditions we keep them in.

* The ""we evolved to eat meat"" argument. Yes, and we can eat chicken, pork and beef. No need to eat lamb even if a vegetarian diet was insufficient. 

Sorry for the long post. I realize it may be a bit tricky, but I really really want my guilt-free lamb roast. So there you have it, my first ever CMV :)

EDIT: Thank you all for the replies! So this has been addressed from 2 perspectives, that got me to change my view:

1. If we go with the alien analogy, if they were to take some human cells and clone some humans on their home world, let them play happily on a field until they are 5, and then slaughter them for food, how immoral would that really be? The children would accept it as the status-quo and enjoy their lives, as they are too young to understand all the ramifications. No parents would have to part from their children, thus causing more suffering. 

2. On the other side, it has been shown that other animals are slaughtered at an even younger age, so my view is inconsistent. Pigs, who are a lot more intelligent than lambs, usually get killed at 5 months. Milk cows are parted from their young as soon as they are born, and the calves get killed quite often only after a few weeks.

"Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 1000 songs in our library. Not to mention, iTunes is the only thing that will properly communicate with my Apple product that I use for music.

I realize you can download pretty much as much music as you want, but to get that, you have to pay. Whereas iTunes is free. I'm not really the type of person who's into discovering brand new music all the time. Occasionally, I'll expand my horizons until I find an artist who really sticks, and then I'll play the crap out of their music until I'm pretty much sick of it. Back in the day, when I had a Zune to play music, they had a similar feature where you could pay a fixed subscription fee to download as much music as you wanted for free. Even back then, an offer like this didn't pique my interest.

Knowing this, are there any standout features that evolve the listening experience so much that I'd be willing to abandon my iTunes library and start over again?

Edit: I've decided that I want to experiment with Spotify and at least try it out. Thank you to all the people who replied. You all gave really helpful information. Also, a side note, this is one of my very first posts and, by miles, my most commented on one. So thank you for the good conversation as well. ","As a former iTunes user, I know how you're feeling - I had a library of thousands of songs that I no longer use. I think it all boils down to a cost-benefit analysis, and how quickly you like to add music to your library.

Using iTunes is free, but you have to pay about a dollar, give or take, for each song (less per song if you purchase an album). With Spotify Premium, you pay $5 per month for unlimited songs. So, if you regularly add more than five songs a month (which I do) then Spotify is definitely worth the fee. The crux of this issue is that it doesn't matter how many songs you *already have in your library*, but *how often you add new ones*.

Although I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that Spotify has a free version (if you can stomach the drawbacks) which offers most of the same benefits. Theoretically unlimited music library for free - hard to beat that.","Cost analysis.

Lets say over the next 2-3 years you plan on buying 500 new songs. If you are buying them as singles, that could easily be $500 as ($1 a song).

Spotify (free version) would already be an upside. Now lets say you want to play your music when you are not at home, and do not have your devices with you. You could use any computer and log on to your playlist and songs.

Then conveniece, you are driving to work and you hear that dope ass song, it is new and you dont have it. you dont need to think about buying it, or if its worth it. You automatically have access to it.

"To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to apply to everyone in society. I am, however, mildly concerned or at least intrigued as to where this debate or issue ends.

The reason it's troubling for me is that the most common arguments used to support gay marriage are that ""love is love"" and ""loving who you choose is your right"". What these arguments implicitly say is that the necessary criteria to be allowed to marry is that you love that which you are marrying.

Now I won't delve into the typical response of ""Next thing you know, it'll be legal to marry your pets!"" because I find that particularly hyperbolic and non-productive to the discussion. But I do feel that this open mindset of the definition of marriage will definitely lead to a future debate about what ""marriage"" is.

I believe that the next group to demand legal marriage rights will be polygamists, and that the same arguments of ""love is love"" will still apply. My fear is that despite this good ruling today, we have opened up the door to extremely loose and liberal interpretations of the meaning of ""marriage"" to include anything we want it to under the law.

~~Further, I believe that polygamy is harmful to society and that raising children in a polygamous is harmful to their growth. I believe that polygamy is not a natural arrangement for humans, and that no matter what, it will be emotionally damaging to at least one person in this ""relationship""~~.

But then as I type those words, I realize that the exact same things were said about gay marriage in recent history. So, Reddit, CMV that this supreme court ruling isn't going to evolve into a culture of people being able to marry whoever (or whatever) or however many people they want.

Edit: Let's avoid the moral implications of Polygamy for now. I shouldn't have typed out my personal views on the matter because it's really not what I'm interested in arguing (whether it's right or wrong). I'm interested in hearing legally, why this SC ruling will not lead to a case law precedent used to affirm Polygamy rights in the future. I ask this because all through this debate, most advocates for gay marriage rights said that comparisons of the movement to polygamy were ridiculous.

The reason why the Court ruled the way that it did, was because the definition of marriage excluded an entire category of people.

Not every legal categorization is given heightened scrutiny by the courts. For instance, legal discrimination on the basis of age is typically legal. When the court asks whether a legal classification is ""suspect"" under the Equal Protection clause, they ask whether the subject class is:


* The group has historically been discriminated against, and/or have been subject to prejudice, hostility, and/or stigma, perhaps due, at least in part, to stereotypes. 

* possesses an immutable and/or highly visible trait. Lyng v. Castillo. 

* are powerless to protect themselves via the political process.  U.S. v. Carolene Products.

2.the argument ""but more people would have been killed!"" is not valid as we will never know if more people were saved, but more importantly if we can't tell if more people were saved how would the people at the time know ?adding to this that japan would of surrendered if given the option which can be argued as more people saved then the bombings (not a unconditionally surrender)

3.saying it was justified trivialises the death, decision caused by them and ignores the moral imprecations of the event.(this is a observation made on reddit) that in discussions people are more focused in saying it is justified and giving the same reasons, rather than actually thinking about the event or have any meaningful decision .

The person supplying that data point could have just been extremely unlucky or extremely lucky. However, when you have say 500 dots, then you can clearly see that the picture will be a Ferrari.  This collection of anecdotes collectively is empirical data. you can perform statistical analysis on it to find am average trend. Rather than seeing just a point, you now have a view of the entire bell curve. If someone was unusually unlucky, you will be able to tell and know that in reality, it's a solid product. Likewise, if someone has been unusually lucky, you can also tell and know that you will most likely get a bad product.

"Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich. However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons:

First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”. Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people’s inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. 

Second of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds. Examples for this are Venezuela or Columbia. 

All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc. However this are minor elements, which I think, should otherwise be implemented in fierce Capitalist society, where in order to succeed you cannot rely on gov. support, but 95 % on yourself.

Edit: I hope this is not too long of an explanation.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","The ""argument from human nature"" gets brought up a lot but is surprisingly easy to refute. From all the socialist books I've read, (and I don't know if you've read any), it is never required theoretically that people should become perfect. Instead, socialism as a theory is conceptualised as one which will more perfectly fit human nature as it is. 

Firstly, what is human nature? The first thing we can say about it is that it is very varied. It is just whatever humans do. But humans do a lot of things. 

The central mistake that proponents of the argument from human nature make is a kind of ""begging the question"". They assume that human behaviour in a capitalist system must be the paradigm of human behaviour per se. I think this is demonstrably false, as a moment's reflection will show. 

For the vast majority of time that humans have existed, they were hunter-gatherers, living in fairly small communities or tribes and practising some form or other of primitive communism, ie, sharing the spoils of the hunt. Social structures were also more or less egalitarian, necessarily, because of required co-operation in the hunt. 

If mankind has a species character, it will be informed by being a hunter-gatherer, living in a social group. Other social forms, cities, states, capitalism, consumerism, and so on, are much later, much more recent developments. 

So what we can take from this about human nature? 1. Humans are a social species, they can collaborate and join their labour together for the common good. 2, Humans are creative, and find meaning and dignity in creativity. And you can also, more tentatively, add: 3. Humans are at their best when free to contract the kinds of social relationships and pursue the creative activities they want.

Well this exactly accords with the species character of man described by Marx and, before him, by the philosophers of the Enlightenment. Man is given naturally to free, cooperative, creative labour. 

Now comes the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution transformed the farm worker into a factory worker, a proletariat. Labour became *necessarily* collaborative again. 

Socialism is nothing more, at a basic level, than a theoretical response to these facts about human nature and human creativity, and the facts of limited global resources and labour. If you want to, you can look at it merely as a rational, efficient use of resources and labour, getting rid of unproductive classes, middlemen, profiteers, production of useless commodities, and so on. 

So to sum up, your ""argument from human nature"" is, as usual when this argument is brought up, based on the usual question-begging and is, I'm sorry to say, based on something of a strawman socialism. I recommend that you read up on the topic and you'll see that no serious socialist writer demands or expects perfectibility. 

Your other objection, that socialism, in order to function properly, would require a world-wide system, is more serious and has more force to it.  But that was only ever a long-term goal and it doesn't follow that we can't try to achieve change in our day-to-day lives, and in our own local polities. After all, world-wide changes have been affected before and they will be again. 

I would also briefly say that very few people advocate a Soviet-style system these days. No-one is anxious to recreate the days of Stalin and gulags and show trials. But once you grasp that that was a deviation from the course of socialism proper, (and was recognised as such at the time by perceptive critics), the goals of socialism in the present day become all the more clear. ","&gt; then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers 

This why the  phrase ""Workers of the World, Unite!"" exists.

Ultimately, the biggest thing that can be done is to unite the working class. Join unions, negotiate better pay and working conditions for everyone the world over.

Obviously this is better achieved at a country level - but it can be expanded worldwide by those who are doing something in their own country, to (for example) only purchase or conduct businesses with other companies in other countries who are also improving the rights of their workers. Ultimately, everyone should be paid well for reasonable hours *regardless* of their job. And by ""well"" I mean a lot more than lowest earners are currently getting, by ""well"" I mean a wage that allows people to *live* and not work for little return.

This is achievable, and will have a real impact on the entirety of humanity. It will change the economy from that of an exploitative one, to one that promotes good pay for all, and allow us to live our lives, follow our dreams, and work in careers we wish to, instead of being wage slave until we die.

Right now there is a strike on the underground system in London. Instead of people supporting them in improving their work life, and using this as inspiration to improve *their* own work conditions and pay, people are attacking them. Calling them overpaid, greedy etc (when really the people who are doing the attacking and name calling are weak and powerless as they are too afraid to do the same thing - if someone has what you don't have, you should aim to get the same, not take away from what they have.

"This stemmed from a discussion I had on another sub about the Greek economic crisis, and what people are saying should have been done in terms of policy by the EU and the Greek government, which dovetails with what I heard should have been done by the US government in 2008-2010 in the worst part of the Great Recession.

My understanding of Keynesian theory as applied to this kind of economic situation is that it prescribes the government to spend money by using public debt, getting that money to the worker and the spending class. This money, once spent, will require producers to produce more, meaning they need to hire more people, which will give those people more money to spend, creating a virtuous circle of economic growth.

Once recession is over and growth is good, the theory then says that the government should raise revenue out of the booming economy by taxing the producers, the saving class, and the wealthy so as to pay down the debt that it acquired in the previous step.

From that, I conclude that Keynesianism is always either for the working class, the spending class, and the generally poor; and/or against the capitalist, the saving class, and the generally rich. The activities of the former group are economically good and should be encouraged; the activities of the latter group are economically bad (albeit necessary) and should be discouraged, minimized to only what’s absolutely needed to support the activities of the former group.

At this point, I see five possibilities:

1.	Keynesian economics is pure class warfare. Keynes and his followers believe that the working class deserves more and the capitalist class deserves less, and developed a theory to fit that opinion. 
2.	Keynesian economics is *co-opted* by people with an agenda of pure class warfare. It’s perfectly valid under the theory to create the virtuous circle through government spending on Rolls-Royces and summer homes for the rich, and perfectly possible to pay down government debt by heavy taxes on working-class activities like buying groceries and holding personal debt. *How* we spend and tax isn’t the issue, just that we do.
3.	I have an incomplete understanding of Keynesian theory. There can arise economic situations where alternative actions are recommended. For instance, once the economy is growing and the debt is paid, does Keynesianism say to reduce both taxes and spending so as to “shake up the system” and achieve new growth? Or any other situation where good economic policy is to increase inequality and use the natural human jealousy, envy, and fear to spur people to produce more?
4.	I have an inaccurate understanding of Keynesian theory in general. 
5. My understanding is accurate, but my logic is faulty.

Right now my view is hovering between One and Two, but I’d really like to understand this theory better.

It's a little more complicated than that. You are partly-correct, but missing some key information.

"So I'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player, Zach Jesse, was banned presumably because of his past criminal history which includes a sexual assault guilty plea when he was 19. I'm not aware of the exact circumstances surrounding his offense. 

What unsettles me about the ban is that it seems to have occurred because another player, Drew Levin, pointed out Jesse's criminal past with a Twitter post: """"Quick reminder: Zach Jesse is a literal rapist who got away with serving three months of an eight year plea deal."" It should be noted that this is a very speculative and misleading statement, as the public is not aware of the details surrounding his plea.

Wizards of the Coast gave a short statement saying that the reasoning behind the ban was to ensure that players feel safe at events. Obviously a worthy endeavor, but I don't see how it really applies here. We are talking about large events at convention centers with thousands of people, security, etc. If, in the eyes of the law, he is not considered a threat to the public (i.e. not in jail) then how can Wizards see him as one?

And what's the point in attempting to rehabilitate criminals if they are to be forever shunned from participating even in large public events? It's not like the guy is applying for a teaching job at an elementary school or something. They even banned him from online play.

Lastly, I do not think Wizards should have taken this action based on a Twitter witch-hunt that was started by another player. If they want to have a universal no criminal record policy at all of their events, then maybe it would be justified. But to selectively ban one person because he was villified on a social media site is pretty unreasonable, IMO.

I want to hear people's thoughts on this because it seems like the r/magictcg community is vehemently opposed to the ban. I'd like to hear some outside opinion's. The SRS crowd seems to support the ban, calling r/magictcg a bunch of rape apologists, etc, but then again the SRS crowd is not very logical or reasonable. So I'd like to hear what you all think. CMV,

Edit: If anyone can provide a source that he was convicted of rape, I will award you a delta.

Edit: So my view has been changed due to new information I have been made aware of regarding the details of Jesse's crime. Anally raping an unconscious girl over a toilet is pretty despicable, I had no idea his offense was even close to that magnitude. Thanks everyone who responded here. I can understand with why Wizards does not want someone who has done something so vulgar to be a top name in their tournament scene.

He is a violent sex offender.  He has to let the police know where he lives and works at all times so they can keep tabs on him.

While the charge was reduced from rape the statement of facts which he admitted was accurate as part of his plea agreement states that he anally and vaginally raped a girl.

I'm not sure if this is enough, but you can read a report on it [here](http://www.readthehook.com/95057/news-uva-rape-case-student-accepts-lesser-charge). He was charged with rape and plead to aggravated sexual battery (according to [this](http://www.wm.edu/offices/police/sexualassault/laws/) the difference is vaginal penetration, though I couldn't find that in the statutes specifically). He plead guilty to aggravated sexual battery because a rape conviction has a 5 year minimum sentence and that charge was dropped because of the plea, not because of the specific facts at hand.

This would be in line with the tweet:

It doesn't say *convicted* rapist, it says *literal* rapist. I can't see anything where he argues he didn't have sex with her, just that it was consensual and/or the alcohol's fault. The aggravated sexual battery charge alone would match other state's as well as some people's colloquial definition of ""rape."" If this was nonconsensual (as he plead guilty to) and involved penetration then it would indeed be rape, and the lesser charge would be an artifact of the plea  bargaining system (as the person mentions).

"So, I saw a commercial today about a pill that helps with BED, and I did a bit of quick research on it. From what little research I did, it is being framed as along the same lines of bulimia and anorexia. On [this website] (bedaonline.com), the causes sound very similar to plenty of other mental disorders, but nothing specifically points out that this is something that qualifies as a mental illness other than ""genetics"".  Also, among their treatment options, you've got ""movement classes"", yoga, and meditation. If it were truly a mental illness, wouldn't it be a little hard to just will away? These treatment options seem to just be a really nice ways of saying...go on a diet.

I don't want to be insensitive about this subject, thus why I'm here. The main issue I have with this ""disease"" is that essentially feels like a medical excuse for a lack of self discipline and dedication. They've even got a pill for it. If stretched far enough, this can include other eating disorders, but BED seems to differ in that anorexia and bulimia stem from a lack of positive body image. BED, on the other hand, seems to err in the opposite direction. You eat because you're sad, and then you are disgusted because you just ate three times what you should have, so you eat again.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who replied. There's been tons of valid points made here, and I haven't been able to reply to every one of them, but I I do have several different ideas to consider about the viewpoint. I looked at the issue through a dirty lens, and I appreciate you all for helping me see it a bit more clearly. There's still a bit more work for me to be done, but my view certainly has changed on the topic. When I get a chance, I'll reply to a few more of the comments and continue rewarding deltas, because my phone screwed that up somehow. Thanks again.

DSM-IV, binge-eating disorder was not recognized as a disorder but rather described in Appendix B:
Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study and was diagnosable using only the catch-all category
of “eating disorder not otherwise specified.”

&gt;Binge eating disorder is defined as recurring episodes of eating significantly more food in a short period
of time than most people would eat under similar circumstances, with episodes marked by feelings of
lack of control. Someone with binge eating disorder may eat too quickly, even when he or she is not
hungry. The person may have feelings of guilt, embarrassment, or disgust and may binge eat alone
to hide the behavior. This disorder is associated with marked distress and occurs, on average, at least
once a week over three months.

&gt;This change is intended to increase awareness of the substantial differences between binge eating
disorder and the common phenomenon of overeating. While overeating is a challenge for many Americans,
recurrent binge eating is much less common, far more severe, and is associated with significant
physical and psychological problems.

Now the reason why it's a disorder is because it's associated with physical and/or psychological problems. If it's in the DSM V as a disorder, it's a disorder in the medical sense. Your objection to this seems to be not specific enough to address within this scope.

The point of defining disorders is so they can be looked at collectively across healthcare providers, researchers, and insurers. Etiology is not necessary to find before defining a disorder.

Mental illness can come from multiple sources, your depressin can be genetics or a bad childhood or from chronic adult stress. And it's not correct to say anorexia and bulimia stem from body image issues. That's certainly the case for some but it's not a necessary feature. 

The other thing to keep in mind is having a diagnosis doesn't absolve you of responsibility from your problem, it just means that medicine recognizes that it's far more difficult for you to overcome the problem with just the tools in your own head.

"I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking ""Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery.""

* Using chopsticks is at best a cultural exercise of contortion.

* Forks and knifes are superior in every way I can imagine &amp; in every situation.

Including :

* rice that is sticky and particularly rice that isn't sticky.

* versatility while eating different kinds of food

* eating with manners

* not having to fear the dreaded fall of food

I hope some of you will be able to help me find arguments to coerce me into using those chopsticks :)


-----------

**Update**

Some facts I've accepted regarding the chopsticks:

&amp;nbsp;

* Exercise fine motor skills

* Give time to taste the food and appreciate it

* Can be used while doing other things

* Are easier to clean, produce and carry

&amp;nbsp;

* Are superior if you want to:
 
 * Preserve the integrity of the food you eat (If you don't want to break a grapevine until it's in your mouth)

 * Eat crusty things (popcorns, cheetos, peanuts...) without dirtying your hands

 * Eat leafs or salad

&amp;nbsp;

* You can have makeshift chopsticks easily while makeshift knifes and forks are still not a thing in 2015.

* Historically better at not stabbing your enemy during dinner?

* Let this be noted, the spoon and the spork were proposed and I'm all in their favors! As for the sporfe, knifoon
and spooned knork I'm more dubious.

&amp;nbsp;

*All of this may be quite situational but in those situations I accept chopsticks as superior*.

"My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in the wild is ""xe/xer/xerself"" or ""zi/zis/zimself"". My argument is as follows:

1. Pronouns are always dealing with a spectrum. A ""he"" can be used to describe both masculine as well as feminine men and similarly for she and women. The singular they is also covering a spectrum, the spectrum of all people that do not identify with either gender or those that identify with both to differing degrees. Therefore they is sufficient to describe alternative gender identities.
2. If we'd decide that new pronouns are necessary to describe or be inclusive to specific non-standard gender identities, we would very likely end up with a sheer infinite amount of pronouns. Since the argument for further pronouns would not be based on scientific facts but rather on feelings of individual people, the argument why some new pronouns are okay and others aren't would be a very difficult one to make. The result would be that we would have to allow anyone to pick or create their own pronouns.
3. Since we'd have a large number of new pronouns people would very likely get confused, since they'd not only have to remember a name and a face but also the specific pronouns of a person AND incorporate those into everyday speech. The result would either be that people would start inadvertently giving offence or our speech patterns would change to rely far more on using names instead of pronouns. 
4. Having a wide range of new pronouns would actively harm the English language by making it less clear. Encountering unknown pronouns would confuse people and make it difficult to imagine what kind of character is being talked about.

"I believe that people have a **moral obligation** to donate money they do not need. Full stop.

But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of moralizing. The government is established to protect inalienable rights and to allow for fair competition. There are many cases where the government is not doing its job in allowing for fair competition, but I am not speaking about these cases. I'm going to give a few scenarios, and I'd love if someone who disagrees could criticize the conclusions I make.

- There are two pizza delivery companies. One of the company owners, Pablo, spent every night for the past 6 months figuring out how to optimize his business. He found better ways to incubate pizzas, better ways to stack pizzas in his pizza-mobile, and also found better ways to pizza his pizza. Because of this, more people are buying his pizzas. In the next year, Pablo earned three times as much as his competitor. Pablo sends his kids to public school, and has the same amount of kids as his competitor; he goes to the doctor when he is ill, and goes the same amount of times as his competitor; he's an American just like his competitor, and benefits from military defense in the same way; *why on Earth would Pablo have to spend multiple times as much money on these things than his competitor?* I really don't get it, I'm sorry. They utilize the same services in the same exact way, why is Pablo in essence *subsidizing* his competitor's payments just because Pablo is a smarter, more efficient businessman?

- There's a marathon going on in Vermont. Two hundred participants compete for the $1,000 given to first, second, and third place. Each participant puts down $20, which goes toward prize money and ensuring the event is run well. Each winner splits the prize money. At the end of the race, the three winners of first, second, and third place are shocked to find out that they are only taking home $120. The event organizers apparently decided that the winners, despite working harder and simply being better at their craft, and despite equally paying for the organization of the event, should have to pay the other participants for simply existing.

I just don't get it. If I drive to work and pass a bridge, I need to pay the toll because bridges cost money. Great. And perhaps I should pay in proportion to how much I drive, that seems like a good idea as well. But if I make a successful website that utilizes none of the services, and in fact very few services at all, is it not plainly *theft* that a bureaucrat decides where my EARNED money goes? I'd rather donate the money I don't need to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, to environmental causes, to the cure for cancer, but the government seems to be stealing it from me so they can play live-action Battlefield 5: Real Life Edition. 

Someone please explain what I am missing.

"Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality TV cooking show where contestants bid on sabotages to make their competitors fail at cooking the dish that needs to be cooked, and keep the money remaining.  Often, this requires picking a competitor who gets sabotaged.  E.g. ""One of your opponents will give up all their ingredients and have to make their tacos using just what they can recover from this day old salad bar.""

This view is about what the best strategy for handing out a sabotage is.  I think that in the first 2 rounds, when you have a choice, you should always target whoever already has a sabotage.  So if someone gave another competitor the salad bar, and then you're handing out who has to give up all utensils for tinfoil, you should always pick the person who got the salad bar.

The reason is this: you do not win a round of CTK.  You just refrain from losing.  Having the best dish is no better than having the second or third best dish in round one.  You are best off by trying to guarantee one person fails totally.  Because then they go home.

Spreading out the sabotages means its less likely that they'll be crippling (since they're tested to be doable).  If you pile them all on one person though, it becomes much more likely they'll totally fail, thus saving you.

First: there's an alternate strategy that says you should always target the person who you think would be your (personal) toughest competitor, leaving the weaker opponents to survive. Sometimes this may override the advantage that dogpiling provides. 

That said... it really depends on what the sabotages are. I don't think there can really be any one perfect strategy that doesn't depend on specific situations.

Just to use a contrived example (but one which I have seen occur): One of your opponents forgot to get eggs in a baking challenge. You have a sabotage that removes someone's eggs. Under no circumstances should you give your sabotage to that person, even if they already have 2 sabotages assigned to them. Dogpiling would be the worst possible strategy in that situation.

There are many similar examples, such of them more subtle, such as someone that has already lost their knives being given a second sabotage that takes away ingredients that need to be cut, and replaces them with precut ingredients of lesser quality. 

Also, much of the time, the ""dogpile"" strategy doesn't really help, because very often the first sabotage equally effects all of your opponents. So at the very least, an *additional* strategy is needed beyond just ""dogpile"". And it's never helpful on the first sabotage.","I think its best to skip buying sabotages in the first round and save money for the later rounds. I've seen people blow their money too early and have no way to defend themselves in the later rounds. Also you help avoid revenge sabotages, the first round can be such a crap shoot and while the dogpile might ensure one person leaves, you don't know if you've dogpiled a strong chef or a weak chef and wasted money.

Now in the second round I could see this working. If you and the third chef realizes that chef #2 is very strong and adaptable, dogpiling chef #2 would be a solid strategy.",322,"I think its best to skip buying sabotages in the first round and save money for the later rounds.

"The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. If you have a nose that is 2 1/2 inches long and crushed in eye socket, then yes, you have an out. 

However, if you are not disfigured, and your facial syemetry is average, and you are still considered unattractive, well then it's your fault. 

Are you overweight? Your fault. 

Do you dress like a 35 year old male who still lives in his mom's basement, and wears black velcro shoes?  Your fault. 

Are you balding? Depending on the structure of your skull, this is debatable, but you can take steps to mitigate this that don't involve a comb over. Halfway your fault. 

Do you have acne? Take better care of your skin. There are some miracle acne drugs out there. Your fault. 

Do you only wear shit tier clothes every single day because their ""comfortable""? Your fault. 

Do you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you have no concept of fashion? Your fault. 

Do you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you can't afford decent clothes? Work harder, go back to school, still your fault. 

Ladies, do you not wear makeup because it takes too much effort to apply? Your fault. If makeup didn't work there wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar industry surrounding it. 

Do you smell like ass because you don't take a shower every day, use deodorant, and wear cologne/perfume? Your fault. 

Do you have a shit tier job because you have a degree in History? Your fault. 

Men, do you not shave your unibrow/nose hair? Your fault. 

Nearly any excuse you can give for why you are unattractive is something you can control for and therefore makes it your fault. I do not presume to say that taking all these steps will make someone a 10/10 but if you are a 2/10, I firmly believe you can go to a 7/10. Everyone can be a 7/10 out of ten. Again, this bars physical characteristics that you have no control over. If you're a 4'10 male, it's not your fault, you just have shitty height genetics.

"There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is that the vote should be your own, informed choice, rather than letting someone else make the decision for you.


Point 1 - http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-verification-without-id-documents.aspx
The ncsl site details some terribly inefficient and time consuming ways to verify someone's identity without an ID. Time needs to be used to look up data and then more time needs to be spent comparing data. And then more time after that when things dont match up and you have to fix / argue your want through.

Point 2 - I have trouble understanding the argument about how requiring IDs to vote is discriminatory in a bad way. The argument is that requiring an ID would discourage poor people from voting. Even the poorest citizens engage smoking and drinking, which are activities that they probably have been asked for an ID for. I find it inconceivable that someone without an ID would be someone capable of making an informed vote. If you couldn't find the time out of all the years in your life and maybe 10 dollars to get an ID, then I believe that you are the exact type of irresponsible person who should not be voting at all.

Point 3 - There are long lines at voting and requiring IDs would cut it down. The government requires employers to pay workers while they take off to go vote. I can think of many employers who will tell you to take the whole day off rather than pay you a full day for half a day's work. This is a partially broken law which only works for full time employees. Part time employees, which generally make less money, often cannot take advantage of this. I'd make the argument that by not requiring ID's to vote, they are discriminating against people whose time is more valuable than voting. I believe the best way to encourage voting is to make voting easier and less time consuming. 

Point 4 - Perhaps instead of trying to tackle enormously expensive projects like free healthcare and free college, we can start with the easy and low cost / high benefit ones like free ID cards.","You have a major unrecognized assumption. You assume that it is as easy as going down to some place and paying $10 to get an ID. If you do not have an address (that is, very poor) it is essentially impossible to get an ID. If you don't have a birth certificate, which is more likely if you are poor, (not born in a hospital, parents didn't keep good track of it, house burned down, got robbed, etc,) it is very difficult to get one, and essentially impossible to get any other ID until you do. 

These same factors are also one of the huge obstacles to escaping poverty. I have always wanted someone to film an experiment where they pretend their ID, cell phone and home don't exist, and try to get government assistance or a permanent job, because it seems largely impossible.","At the moment, in most states, the requirement to vote is to fill out a card asserting you are eligible.  It is up to the state to show that you are not eligible.  The burden of proof is on the state to prove whether you are or are not eligible.

With a mandatory voter ID, you've moved the burden of proof onto the citizen to prove that they are eligible to vote.  They have to have proof of a birth certificate, social security card, utility bill, or some other form of proof.  With elderly or poor people, they may not have these documents available, and voter ID has passed the burden of proof onto the voter.

Having or not having an ID doesn't make a significant difference in voting lines.  At least in my experience, the bottleneck is almost always the booths themselves, not the sign-in portion.  If you want to make voting more accessible, move to a 24 hour voting period.  I think that would be even better than declaring voting day a holiday - if you run elections from 7 PM to 7 PM or whatever, then even part-time workers with multiple jobs should have some time to vote.",324,"You have a major unrecognized assumption.

"I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do.

Every child growing up seems to desire coffee, but only because it's age restricted, similar to alcohol/tobacco. Now I don't have a PhD in psychology or anything, but there is evidence beyond proof that people want what they can't have. It's just human nature, and I feel like it's what's behind the longterm desire for coffee in that something I was once barred from is now freely enjoyed and encouraged. It doesn't help that many people jack their cups with sugars and creams which at a certain point require speculation as to which substance is actually fueling your perceived energy boost.

I consider myself to be very openminded, especially when it comes to substances put into the body for recreational purposes (I'll leave it at that) but I can't seem to see eye-to-eye to my friends that have been religiously trying to convert me all these years.

The extent of my coffee experience would be instant coffee growing up at home (parents weren't 'connoisseurs' by any iteration of the term but were both pretty addicted to), pretentious (shots fired) coffee shops that my fiends would literally drag me to, and the occasional tinder date Starbucks run in which I would just end up getting the vanilla bean frappe 90% of the time, which is delicious by the way.

It seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.

Could that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee? Has my past experienced not done justice to an entire culture that is coffee? I mean people spend hundreds of dollars a year on it, and for what?

While coffee is not the only way to get caffeine, the majority of people who drink coffee are doing so mostly for the caffeine.  If you don't need the caffeine in your daily routine, then this would make sense as a reason that you do not need to drink coffee.  I would also like to point out that different people have different sensitivities to the drug, so you might be tolerant enough to the extent that you don't feel any obvious effects after a single cup.  As caffeine tends to be subtle, this is highly likely (especially if you have already been getting the proper amount of sleep).

As far as taste goes, it is an acquired taste.  I am a fan of things that taste bitter in general, so coffee is not that big of a jump for me, but most people do not like bitter flavors as much as so coffee may be a bit too strong of a flavor for them.  There is also the fact that the majority of the easy to access coffee doesn't actually taste very good.  The main objective of most coffee is to get caffeine into the body, and so it sacrifices taste to make it easier to brew in large amounts.  the instant coffee that you reference being familiar with is one of the worst offenders in this area.  It is specifically designed to be easy to prep so someone who is not fully awake early in the morning can get their coffee going without much hassle.  That easy of use naturally sacrifices it being optimized for taste.

&gt;It seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.

Starbucks actually doesn't have very good straight coffee.  Their plain coffee tends to be burnt and generally over cooked.  However, most of their products sell not based on their coffee, but on the sugar and cream that they add to most drinks.  As such, it is a great place to get coffee if you don't like the taste of coffee and want to hide it with other flavors so you can still get the caffeine, but as far as people who like plain coffee, it is not very good.

If you ever want to try what is generally considered the best coffee in the world, find a good Turkish restaurant and order a Turkish coffee.  It is very bitter, so if you are not a fan of bitter you will not like it, but everyone who likes coffee likes Turkish coffee (as a side note, Turkey is one of the first cultures to regularly drink coffee, so they have some of the oldest traditions and recipes associated with coffee).  If you are a fan of alcohol at all, you can try an Irish coffee.  It is like a normal coffee, but instead of adding milk, Irish cream or whiskey is added (often served with a bit of whipped cream on top).  It is one of my favorite alcoholic mixed drinks.

&gt;Have I just had bad coffee? Has my past experienced not done justice to an entire culture that is coffee?

I think so.  It is a drink with about 500 years of history behind it, and in that time some people have made it exceptionally good.  However, as teh majority of coffee is served not for taste but for the caffeine, it is likely that you haven't had any super high quality coffee before.  The is also the possibility that you are just not a fan of bitter tastes in general, in which case coffee may never appeal to you.","On top of what's already been said, the reason why 'espresso connoisseurs' hate Starbucks is because they burn their beans (over-roast them) which produces a strong bitter taste, and then they overload it with sugar to mask the bitter taste. This is fine if you don't like the taste of espresso

Starbucks is like it's own subdivision of espresso centered a bit more around the sugar. And that's fine, and clearly tons of people enjoy it enough to make it the large enterprise it is. But the people who've had and loved actual espresso, and learned to enjoy the taste of it, will be shocked upon trying Starbucks to find that the espresso part of the drink tastes like shit, and there's way too much sugar. It'd be like enjoying fine local craft beers all your life, then being thrown a Bud Lite. Sure, Bud Lite is popular, but it doesn't have what someone who enjoys craft beer is looking for. Or lets say you grew up having fresh, delicious hamburgers from the cows on your farm along with fries from potatoes you grew at home, then you had a McDonalds Big Mac. Shit, I love myself the occasional McDonalds, but it scratches an entirely different itch than homemade hamburgers and fries.

"* As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.  
* Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic.
* Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. 
* I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the ""warm glow"" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. 
* Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture. Because of climate change, and the overuse of farmlands we may reach that point in the near future.

If life were just dollars and cents followed by investments for more dollars and cents then your argument would be pretty ironclad.  

But what if government's role is *not* to mimic business?  Instead government intends to create sustainable societies where all members have an opportunity for a life worth living.  The thing about that statement is that *all members* means **all members**.  

If life has not just an instrumental value, but an intrinsic value then it is our duty to protect it.  Inversely if life only has instrumental value, then we do not need to protect it in other senses either.  If it's cheaper to send 40x as many soldiers as it is to build better weapons then we just throw soldiers at the problem.  If it's cheaper to threaten the lives of workers than to demand that they wear protective gear then we just throw people into the machine.

Most people would agree that life itself has a value.  You are attempting to draw the line at the types of lives which have value while disregarding the rest in some sort of culling. ","All of your points are rooted in a broadly utilitarian philosophy, which holds that whichever action increases utility is the morally correct one to make - in the case of your argument, it is mainly economic utility. It fails to take into account a number of things. Firstly, there is another definition of 'utility' - the maximisation of pleasure. Letting sick children die is an exercise in cold pragmatism, and not an action (or consequence of deliberate inaction, more specifically) that anyone would relish or enjoy. There is undeniable value in allowing and encouraging a society to feel good about itself, and failure to take that into account would result in a society that has less esteem in itself, and therefore a society that functions less efficiently, and is more likely to descend into dysfunction. Indeed, Jeremy Bentham, considered the founder of modern utilitarianism, said that, ""it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong"".

To look outside of utilitarian philosophy, I would also hold that your suggestion runs contrary to the entire point of government, which is look after its citizens, to safeguard their lives and livelihoods. A government should - and most, thankfully, do, to at least some extent - look after the needs of its most vulnerable citizens, *regardless of whether or not this is of any economic benefit*. Taking a ruthlessly pragmatic approach to the lives and well-being of the citizens in their care is not the mark of a functional government trying to foster a stable society, but of a government trying to trim society down to its bare, self-sustainable bones - in other words, not a government trying to its best for the people, but a government trying to make itself obsolete in one of the most brutal ways possible.

",326,"All of your points are rooted in a broadly utilitarian philosophy, which holds that whichever action increases utility is the morally correct one to make - in the case of your argument, it is mainly economic utility.

","Your entire argument sees human life from an instrumental perspective.  If life were just dollars and cents followed by investments for more dollars and cents then your argument would be pretty ironclad.  

But what if government's role is *not* to mimic business?  Instead government intends to create sustainable societies where all members have an opportunity for a life worth living.  The thing about that statement is that *all members* means **all members**.  

If life has not just an instrumental value, but an intrinsic value then it is our duty to protect it.  Inversely if life only has instrumental value, then we do not need to protect it in other senses either.  If it's cheaper to send 40x as many soldiers as it is to build better weapons then we just throw soldiers at the problem.  If it's cheaper to threaten the lives of workers than to demand that they wear protective gear then we just throw people into the machine.

Most people would agree that life itself has a value.  You are attempting to draw the line at the types of lives which have value while disregarding the rest in some sort of culling. ",r2,0.7,0.6,0.8,0.6,0.7,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.9,0.0,0.0,0.7,0.5,0.8,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,r1,,

I was a spoiled lazy kid because I never got a job.  Had my priorities mixed up and flunked.  I got a job in the real world, and it was painful, but humbling.  If I had gotten a job at 18 (or sooner), I would've done much better in college and learned crucial life lessons sooner.  There's also lots of other people who are deluded and spoiled because they don't work.

I won't allow my kids to go to college without having worked first.

* I'm not restricting this purely to retail, but retail teaches humility.  It teaches you how to be diplomatic, how you're not the center of the universe, sometimes you have to tolerate shit, things won't always go your way.  And after working a retail job, you'll treat other retail workers with more respect.

* Having a job also teaches the reality of the world versus theory.  I used to be a hardcore Republican who thought poor people didn't have it THAT bad and wealthy people deserve to live 100x better because they work harder.  Now, I see the real challenges average people face, especially in the ghetto.

* Having real world experience will help you just as much (you'll encounter lots of people, learn your strengths and weaknesses), if not more than spending years in college ""finding yourself"".  If you have no idea what you want to do in college, you're going to waste lots of time.

* Lots of college kids are entitled because parents/government pay for everything.  And they think they automatically deserve a high-paying job just because they graduated.  Nope, gotta work your way up from the bottom.  Nobody's too good for an entry-level job.

* Oh, and it doesn't hurt to have a little more on your resume.

"Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view i hold.  My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any or all of them or bring up new issues I haven't thought of.  

1) Unpopular: The draft for the war in Vietnam was extremely unpopular with massive protests and draft dodging.  After the draft was eliminated the protests died down even as the war continued.  It seems that America will support a lot of military activity (Iraq War 1 &amp; 2, Afghanistan, etc) as long as they are not personally forced to serve.  

2) No close border crisis: Other modern developed countries have forced selective service (South Korea, Israel) but usually these countries face bordering existential crises to their very existence.  America does not have this, has not ever had this, and presumably will not ever have this and so there is no need to have millions of men and women be conscripted every year for a tour of duty.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription

3) Nuclear Weapons: America may face small attacks here and there but no nation state large enough to possibly overthrow the United States government seems likely to attack for fear of nuclear weapons retaliation.  While 9/11 was a tragedy, there was no hope of terrorists taking over the country or overthrowing the government.  The only world forces strong enough to do this would be large nations with large militaries of their own and if they did have a mainland ground force invasion of US soil it would almost guarantee a nuclear response.

4) Women, and the out of shape:  This is a minor reason but none the less I'll bring it up for discussion.  In a modern draft there would be seemingly no way for women to avoid serving.  Currently women face demanding physical aptitude tests to qualify for the most demanding positions or in some cases are barred from service for fear they will not be able to handle the physical requirements of the job (front line combat, Navy Seals, etc).  In the 21st century when men and women have equal rights and are largely treated equally there would be pushback if those less capable of serving were thought to be more likely to get an easier or safer assignment.  This would create a race to the bottom for applicants seeking to avoid dangerous duty.  Furthermore the vast majority of Americans are overweight, out of shape, and would require extensive training to become combat ready.  If diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, or any number of conditions would disqualify a person from service I imagine people would quickly engage in unhealthy habits (or bribe doctors) in order to avoid service. 

5) Conscientious objectors: In previous generations there was a much stronger sense of duty, warrior culture, and sense of imminent danger which cultivated a value in service.  In the modern world, where people increasingly distrust their government, have more access to information, and are more likely to have diverse religious and philosophical views I do not see the public getting behind any major military involvement that would require a draft.  I would imagine there would be a rush to qualify yourself as a conscientious objector to the war in order to avoid combat even if that individual didn't feel that way immediately prior to the draft.  

Please change my view!","You're only considering military threats, there are other scenarios that could mean large numbers of troops are needed, for a range of tasks.

A huge natural disaster, such as a large scale volcanic eruption, small meteor impact, solar flare that knocks out the electrical supply worldwide - all of these would have massively disrupting implications in the US at home, and abroad. Civil disorder, food and water supplies being disrupted, large numbers of refugees, all of these could require the military to step in, requiring large numbers of additional personnel, which might have to be drafted.","The US will revert to a draft as soon as the US deems it necessary - which is when the number of volunteers do not met the numbers required.

To counter some of your points, look at this example: World War II.

During World War II, [over 10.1 million](https://www.sss.gov/induct.htm) of the US's sixteen million service members were *drafted*

That's right, WW2, a popular war most people today agree was worth fighting for, drafted over 60% of its servicemembers. Simply put: the US needed manpower, it drafted even when 6 million men volunteered.

Keep in mind too that conscientious objection was an even bigger issue in the past than today. The US was staunchly isolationist up until WW2, and many religious exemptions existed for groups like the Quakers.

In addition, those servicemembers all served overseas. In fact, Vietnam was similar - the US maintained more troops in West Germany during this time than in Vietnam. Conscripts weren't sent just to fight in Vietnam - many were sent to fill in ranks in Germany to keep our obligations there. 

Our obligations worldwide are smaller today, true, but they still exist and may certainly grow again in the future.",328,"The US will revert to a draft as soon as the US deems it necessary - which is when the number of volunteers do not met the numbers required.

I watched the documentary on A-Sexualism and I'm not convinced. I think these people that identify as ""asexual"" either haven't found the 'right' person for them yet, are just looking for attention, or just joining part of a trend to seem 'interesting' or 'different'. I think if you're born with a set of a genitals, you are in fact a sexual being and in turn, feel some sexual attraction to other humans. I understand how this can be offensive. I look at my brother who is gay and I understand where he comes from, and the obstacles he overcomes through being gay, and I just can't sympathize with people who identify as 'asexual' and implicate that they endure the same struggles as someone from the LBGT community. Please change my view! ","Being asexual is definitely not a choice. While some kids may ""try on"" asexuality just like some kids experiment with bisexual or gay relationships in their early years, it's something that wears on you over time. If there is one solid expectation of you in society, it's that everyone wants to get laid. Sex is such an integral part of our relationships and our perceived value in relationships. Can you think of the last time you got aroused? Can you imagine *never* having been aroused? Isn't it such a strange thought?

That's how many asexuals feel about the idea of sexual attraction. It's *strange* and foreign. And because we have that powerful disconnect from something which is a strong underlying motivation for the human existence, we're constantly being judged in our relationships--from friendships, to family, and of course our partners as well. 

Many asexuals find the right person for them, but the relationship isn't viable because a sexual connection is very important for most people. Even if an asexual is willing to have sex, it's never going to be that powerful ""perfect fit"" sex that partners with good chemistry have. 

People are extremely uncomfortable at the idea of asexuality. It's definitely not something you can choose.


####*personal anecdote follows*


I'm 30 years old and asexual. This is a throwaway. I've come to strongly resent my asexuality at this point in my life. Maybe because I spent most of my life trying to ignore it, then trying to fix it, and then ultimately concluding that I am stuck with it.

I've went my entire life and felt no physical attraction to another human being, and it's a really hard concept for a lot of people to understand. I've actually had my mother tell me ""I wish you were gay just so I could understand!"" and that's difficult to hear because that's right up there with being a satanist for her (conservative roots here).

I think there is definitely some people that participate in sexual ""trends"" per se as they are growing older and finding their sexual identity. It's just a natural part of experimenting and finding out about your own body and what you like. Or, maybe people think because they've never been laid that they must clearly be asexual because that seems like a better club to be in than undesirable.

You really start noticing a gap between you and your friends very quickly, though. There's different shades of asexuality, but I remember so clearly being that weird kid who was completely uninterested in sex but that many people found very attractive. Emotionally, I can connect to other people like anyone else. While I didn't desire sex, I desired to make an emotional connection. So I dated... and dated, and dated. When I was young, I had the excuse that (being in a conservative area), I was waiting for marriage even though I wasn't religious at all. As you can imagine, though, this gets pretty old with young kids wanting to rut everywhere. I got talked about a lot, and not in a good way. 

As an adult, I didn't really have any excuses anymore. I went to see sex therapists, regular therapists, doctors, and anyone else who would listen trying to fix myself. Medically, there's nothing wrong with me.

I stopped dating for a long time. I came to realize that for most other people, sex was a necessary part of a relationship and that they couldn't feel connected without it. That thought was as alien to me as my lack of sexuality was to my boyfriends.

I've been dating my fiance for three years now. Emotionally, we have a really powerful bond but physically I struggle. We do have sex, sometimes. It's tedious and unpleasant for me but I try to make it nice for him. I like cuddling afterwards because I feel like I've endured something that has brought us closer together. We both struggle with my asexuality because it's really hard for a partner to understand that there's nothing they can do to change it but it doesn't mean I don't love him. ","&gt; I think if you're born with a set of a genitals, you are in fact a sexual being and in turn, feel some sexual attraction to other humans.

You're making the same leap in logic that people make regarding sex change operations.  *""If you have a penis, you're a boy.  If you have vagina, you're a girl""*.  It's definitely *easier* to dismiss someone's ideas than to consider them, but that doesn't make it accurate.

&gt;  I just can't sympathize with people who identify as 'asexual' and implicate that they endure the same struggles as someone from the LBGT community

Why would that be?  Sexuality is strongly tied to identity.  

Imagine all of the cues that society gives a person who is sexual sexual. Everything from who they are having sex with (IE disparities in attractiveness, age, race, etc) is scrutinized.  Also the kinds of sex that you are open about having strictly helps to categorize you somewhere in the system.  Almost everything about sex is in some public sense taboo.  

Even without sex, there's a lot of bonding among men and women (separately or together) regarding sexuality.  Just looking at an attractive person passing you by and nodding to your buddy.  Or discussing events, celebrations or just making up.  Sex is a common topic of discussion.

Then there's the media.  Sexuality drives us to buy everything from beer to gym memberships.  It's a tool which is used because it works.  If it didn't work on you, you would find it more than just superfluous, it would be frustrating to be exposed to it regularly.


It is a factor of identity which is deeply ingrained in society and ubiquitous in daily life.

"I'm not a native english speaker so excuse me.

Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, and though I believe the world is not black and white and there is a grey area in between, what is that grey area? I haven't been able to figure it out like, for example: a man steals food from a shop because he doesn't have enough money and he needs to feed his kids, then he gets caught and taken to prison. Though he did something ""bad"" (stealing) for a ""good"" cause (feed his children), he still did something bad therefore he gets a punishment. Where's the grey in that? I don't know.

That's one of my confusions, the grey between the black and white. To be clear, I'm not bigoted or religious and I understand there are diferent types of good and different types of bad depending on your context, where you live.

The other thing I'm confused about and that is fairly linked to the first one is if there's something besides ""the good"" and ""the bad"". I personaly live by trying to do the good but I also think that the bad is necesary until a certain degree.

Because if black and white exist - grey must also. And if grey exists, so must black and white! You can't have grey without it's mix of black and white.

What a person sees - whether black/white/grey (or roygbiv!) is a function of their knowledge and understanding. They might claim there is no black and white for a number of reasons. If what is right or wrong to them seems morally confusing, they might say black and white don't exist - because that's what life feels like to them. Or if a person believes he is not the cause of his actions he might say black/white don't exist, believing that life is a series of predetermined or random events we have no control over. Or a person might believe philosophically that right and wrong are all a matter of subjective or cultural perspective.

There *are* plenty of difficult choices with moral implications to make in life that you will not immediately know what the right thing to do is. E.g. should you live with your father or mother if they split up and you believe you love them equally? What's the right thing to do? For the moment of uncertainty, you may acknowledge the existence of grey.

Now to your example: if you have exhausted all other options and your baby is dying, should you steal to save it's life? 

You said that stealing was bad/black, and saving your baby was good/white. Are you sure? You can't morally evaluate a particular choice *in isolation* of the context, the reasons, cause and effect, means and ends. 

In a certain context like in this example, stealing *is* the absolute, objectively right *moral* choice. Stealing is *right*! (Others may call it grey - you may call it black. But I believe it's 100% objectively white). In an emergency context, what is right and wrong must be re-arranged as a temporary measure so that the good survives. Of course, after the baby is saved, the father is still morally obliged to pay back what he has stolen.




","The Universe can't be divided into good and bad because 'good' and 'bad' are just descriptions of how parts of that universe, interact with humans on a subjective level.



By that I mean that 'bad' means about the same thing as 'soft', or 'warm to the touch'. Warmth and the softness of something is really just a description of the subjective feeling that object has in its interaction with humans. 

We can express this interaction in more complex ways, and we can measure and relate this feeling to other, less subjective criteria, like:temperature for warmth and coefficient of friction/ and description of material surface and its interaction with other materials. 

But in the end, we're just relating two physical properties of bits of the Universe, with the subjective feeling that we experience, as a physical organism.


Now the above examples are much more wishy-washy, because of the fact that something like warmth *is* able to be objectively measures by an accurate outside source, like temperature. Good and bad are just the two general categories of 'responses' that we lump things in. Getting stung by a bee feels bad, and causes pain, swelling and a sometimes dangerous interaction with an outside chemical that you're body has a conditioned, negative-reinforcing experience to.

Most people would be comfortable in firmly putting 'being stung by a bee' under the 'bad' response category. But what about something more complex, and subtle? Like a tickle? The exact same sensation could be pleasurable, infuriating, hilarious, sexual, annoying and downright maddening, all based on the (very,very,very) complex interactions happening in your brain, which we call consciousness.


Is tickling bad, or good? Well answering which category to put that in could be either an easy choice, or a very difficult one, depending on any brains subjective and unique experience of it.




From these examples we can see how the idea that there is no middle ground between good and bad, is comparable (and in some ways I'd say, much *more* incorrect) than saying something like ""There is no middle ground between cold and hot"". 

Of course there are things so hot you'd physically be unable to experience them without instantly rendering your mushy and organic sense organs useless and dead, and of course there are things so cold that it would instantly begin killing and freezing any sensing cells it came into contact with.


But isn't it also obvious that, due to the fact that the transition between warmth and cold is a continuous scale, and the criteria is inherently subjective (Note: I'm talking about warmth, as in the sensation, which while highly correlated to temperature, is not the same thing), than the same must be true for good and bad, and thus there exists a very large grey area while attempting to jam everything into those two categories.",330,"Really, to say ""there is only black and white"" is just as wrong as saying ""there is no black and white - only grey"".

Because if black and white exist - grey must also. And if grey exists, so must black and white! You can't have grey without it's mix of black and white.

What a person sees - whether black/white/grey (or roygbiv!) is a function of their knowledge and understanding. They might claim there is no black and white for a number of reasons. If what is right or wrong to them seems morally confusing, they might say black and white don't exist - because that's what life feels like to them. Or if a person believes he is not the cause of his actions he might say black/white don't exist, believing that life is a series of predetermined or random events we have no control over.

"Snowden leaked classified information, which is a crime, but the circumstances of the leak, and how he did it, are such that he deserves to be pardoned.

Snowden did not leak for personal gain, but for public benefit.  He did not sell secrets to a foreign power.  The programs he revealed [were illegal](https://www.eff.org/files/2015/05/07/aclu_v._clapper_-_court_of_appeals_opinion.pdf).  If he had not been a national security employee, his actions would have been covered by the whistleblower protection act, and not be a crime at all.

Two years on from his leaks, it is clear that Snowden has not acted in a way deserving of legal punishment, and it would be better for the United States if he were to be pardoned and allowed to return home, instead of his looming prosecution, especially considering that [he could not raise a public interest defense](https://freedom.press/blog/2013/12/if-snowden-returned-us-trial-all-whistleblower-evidence-would-likely-be-inadmissible) at trial.  

Snowden broke the law.  But the pardon power exists precisely because the law does not cover all possible contingencies, and there is supposed to be the possibility of mercy in an exceptional case.  Snowden's case is nothing if not exceptional, and he should be pardoned.

Edit:  Ok, I'm heading to bed now.  Thanks for all the responses, I'll try to catch up on more tomorrow - this thread kinda blew up on me.

Edit 2:  I've awarded a delta to /u/MrApophenia who convinced me that the first-best solution would be for Snowden to return to the US on the condition, which he's publicly agreed to, of a trial where he can raise a public interest defense.  If convicted at that trial, a pardon might still be considered.  This would require an assurance that the espionage act charges be permanently dropped.

"I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is the far superior option.

**Cleanliness**

In this area, I prefer toilet paper for a few reasons. First of all, there is actual visual confirmation that you've got it all. With bidets you just have to keep spraying until you think you're good. And as the amount of wiping/bidet-ing can vary greatly, the visual aspect is a great help. (I used a towel to dab afterwards, as toilet paper doesn't hold up against all the water.)

Secondly, a bidet shouldn't be necessary as people (should) shower daily. Many people like to point out that bidets are better because they rinse away bacteria and other nastiness. But, a shower with actual soap and water and scrubbing should do that job much better than just water alone.

**""But you wouldn't just wipe it away if you got some on your hands!""**

No, and I don't think you'd just rinse it away either. You'd use soap and water and scrubbing. Another point, your hands are usually the first thing you use to touch something. Until you grab things with your bare ass, wiping is just as good.

**Comfort**

Good quality toilet paper is amazing. It's soft, thick, almost like Kleenex. Hell, you could wipe with Kleenex if you wanted. Point is that high quality stuff is glorious. On the other hand, you're getting a cold spray of water in a very sensitive area. Even if you have a super luxury bidet that uses heated water, it's still basically shooting water up your ass. Even low quality toilet paper is better than that. In a shower the water flows down, which is much less uncomfortable. With a bidet there's also the added trouble of being all drippy with water while you move to towel off. And unless you want to reach into the bowl with a towel while you're still sitting on it, you're going to have to at least move up to a squat to towel off. (Those with an air dryer feature may alleviate this somewhat, but toweling will probably still be necessary if the air hand dryers are anything to go by.)

**Price**

I understand bidets cost less. But for me and where I am in life, I can and will pay extra for quality. There must be many others who feel the same, or else only single ply sand paper toilet paper would exist. In this area bidets are better, but I think that if this is the reason someone buys a bidet it would be because they have to save money.

**Eco friendliness**

I think we're past the whole 'save the trees' business. Reforestation is greater than reforestation in most of the world. Bidets may actually do more harm in low water and drought areas, if everyone dropped toilet paper and got bidets the gallons would add up.

To clarify; I'm talking about a bidet for home use, that's built into the toilet. The bidets that are completely separate just seem impractical.

Edit: The point here is that given a choice between a bidet and toilet paper, toilet paper is better. In situations where there's no other alternatives, of course one will be used over the other.

So, CMV.

Bidets solve [Andy Dwyer's wiping problem,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGCIGEUB32M) which is more common than people like to talk about. Toilet paper only cleans the external surface.

"I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking ""Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery.""

* Using chopsticks is at best a cultural exercise of contortion.

* Forks and knifes are superior in every way I can imagine &amp; in every situation.

Including :

* rice that is sticky and particularly rice that isn't sticky.

* versatility while eating different kinds of food

* eating with manners

* not having to fear the dreaded fall of food

I hope some of you will be able to help me find arguments to coerce me into using those chopsticks :)


-----------

**Update**

Some facts I've accepted regarding the chopsticks:

&amp;nbsp;

* Exercise fine motor skills

* Give time to taste the food and appreciate it

* Can be used while doing other things

* Are easier to clean, produce and carry

&amp;nbsp;

* Are superior if you want to:
 
 * Preserve the integrity of the food you eat (If you don't want to break a grapevine until it's in your mouth)

 * Eat crusty things (popcorns, cheetos, peanuts...) without dirtying your hands

 * Eat leafs or salad

&amp;nbsp;

* You can have makeshift chopsticks easily while makeshift knifes and forks are still not a thing in 2015.

* Historically better at not stabbing your enemy during dinner?

* Let this be noted, the spoon and the spork were proposed and I'm all in their favors! As for the sporfe, knifoon
and spooned knork I'm more dubious.

&amp;nbsp;

*All of this may be quite situational but in those situations I accept chopsticks as superior*.

"I feel like they're acting and it often feels very campy.

I used to think similarly to you, but after I befriended some trans people, and other people in my life became comfortable enough to come out, I learned more. 

While some hyper-feminine trans women and hyper-masculine trans  men are genuinely just someone who naturally acts like the gender stereotype, a good amount of people who are trans feel a need to overcompensate. I also know some trans people who don't feel the need to preform gender roles, but feel pushed to do so too by people around them or society in general. For example I know a trans woman, but she still doesn't feel like dresses or skirts are really her thing, nor does it bother her to have a bit of stubble, or hairy legs. She'll get comments along the line of 'she's not really trans,' or 'if she actually wanted to be a woman, she'd do x and y'.

So non-gender-conforming trans people exist, but they're not really in the spot light. It's understandable, because we cis people do seem to have even more trouble wrapping our heads around why someone would feel like a man but still want to wear skirts, especially when we're still learning to accept the fact that some people we think of as women are actually men, and vice versa.","As a trans woman (and more importantly as a trans person in general), we are often backed into corners by society: you think that trans women portray themselves as too feminine with dresses and makeup and etc., yet if a trans woman would be seen with hairy legs or facial hair shadow, with no makeup and a short haircut, others might say that she isn't ""trans enough"" or a ""real woman"" because she doesn't conform to these gender roles/expressions or even that she ""looks like a guy."" We're judged by somebody either way, and I think most of us would rather lean toward the direction of gender expression that allowed us to be more often read as our true gender because we've been misgendered all our lives.

Edit: I want to add another point. Why don't cis women get this sort of backlash? Cis women are all over magazines in all sorts of over-the-top feminine outfits and expressions. Why is one trans woman who looks nice and is all done up on the cover of *vanity fair* the enemy of feminists?

"This is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in the upcoming Fantastic Four reboot](http://comicbook.com/blog/2014/02/22/fantastic-four-why-casting-a-black-actor-as-the-human-torch-might-make-a-better-movie/), and the casting of [Emma Stone as Allison Ng in *Aloha*](http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/03/entertainment/cameron-crowe-emma-stone-aloha-apology-feat/). Now, I know both of these examples aren't perfect opposites, but the reception has been wildly different. When Michael B. Jordan was cast as the new Human Torch, people were thrilled. Despite the Human Torch [never once being black in the comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_versions_of_the_Human_Torch), people said this was a good step forward in the superhero film community, and even that changing the typically white role to an black role would add levels of complexity to the story. On the other hand, critics called Stone's casting ""culturally insensitive,"" despite Cameron Crowe stating that the fact she's predominantly white, and has to constantly explain her ""unlikely heritage,"" was an actual aspect of her character, based on a real life redhead with 1/4 Chinese heritage.

I don't mind casting people of color in typically white roles. I think it's good and it should be as inconsequential as POC involvement in other areas of life in the 21st century. In fact, in areas dominated by white characters, like the Marvel Universe, I'm completely open to the idea of adding more roles for POC. But when usually white roles are filled by POC, there's a lot of praise for reaching out and involving other races. Why not just focus on either creating films that feature black or other minority characters, like the [Black Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_(comics), or even start creating more original POC characters to reflect the changing racial landscape? Why is the casting itself of a mixed race character portrayed by a white actor ""insensitive?""

I'd love to hear other thoughts. I've only seen these two issues (minority casting of white roles and white casting of minority roles) tackled separately.

"After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the idea of posting armed guards at schools is brought up the idea is always shot down as ridiculous. It was never given a reason why people look down upon it. I feel that posting armed guards at schools would directly deincentivize any individual from going to violent crimes at schools. And if the individual wanting to commit is suicidal than the armed guards would directly solve the problem and stop the would-be gunmen before the tragedy even starts. All other ideas on curbing gun violence doesn't seem to have the aspects of deincentification and directness that posting armed guards at schools has. That's not to say that ideas are wrong but adding this idea of armed guards to their respective platforms would, in my opinion, help curb school violence better than any of these opinions could individually.

edit*: I see that most peoples points are that school shootings are rare and the expenses involved would be to great. That's a legitimate and fair argument. I still think it should be brought up for discussion but I see why people look down upon it.

"Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times by taking EPO and--when a test for EPO was developed--by taking blood transfusions during the race to increase his red blood-cell levels. He passed all of the blood tests (shy one, where the story of using a particular ointment for saddle-sores was concocted to explain it).

Doping in one form or another is always going to happen, and there will always be another method that can escape detection. If you're a professional athlete, or an amateur competing in high profile tournaments such as the Olympics, then you either dope or you face a significant disadvantage.

I don't think this will ever change, and the consequence is that every winner will be tainted by doubt, so I think the only way to address this is to change the policy to allow specific types of doping.

Ball-shrinking, liver wrecking, life endangering drugs would still be banned for the safety of the athlete, but anything that's either harmless (blood transfusions), or at the same level as ""professional hazard"" (like brain damage for boxers), would be allowed.

One of the things that encourage me to have this view, and that I'd like addressed if it's wrong, is my understanding that the IOC relaxed their criteria for gender verification. 

The reason, as I understand it, is that there were simply too many legitimate side cases, so the hardline rule couldn't be enforced. Someone genetically male might have Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome or XX/XXY mosaicism, for example, and grow up looking like a woman to anyone but a gene lab.

&gt; One form of gender identification, which was mandated for all female olympic athletes by the International Olympic Committee in 1992, tested for the presence of the SRY gene, which is found on the Y-chromosome, to identify males potentially disguised as females. This method of testing was later abolished, as it was shown to be inconclusive in identifying maleness.

"I spend my summer as a representative of the college I attend and interact regularly with kids between the ages of 10 and 18. In these interactions, I have noticed that - regardless of age and gender, these kids are often unable to write in cursive and sometimes even their print Handwriting is hardly legible.
Now, I realize that we live in the digital age and typing is king (I think touch typing should also be taught), but I believe that learning handwriting from an early age (and throughout even high school) has several benefits including...
1) Improved sense of symmetry and order
2) Improved appreciation for art of different time periods
3) Larger/more diverse vocabulary
4) Prepares users for the business world where signatures and other handwritten items are still fairly common

Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I really think good Handwriting is useful even in the digital age.

I am not disputing the fact that the United States achieved its principal military/political goals (defeat of the Third Reich and the Japanese Empire), and I of course recognize the fact that the US managed to do so with virtually no civilian casualties/ destruction of the homeland, which is especially impressive given the sheer scale of civilian destruction seen in World War II.

What I am arguing is that, having 'won' (as much as it is possible to win) the war, the United States promptly lost its soul, and has ended up in a worse position than Germany or Japan. The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.

I think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on. It's a cycle that only leads to cartoonishly large military budgets and American blood spilled in conflicts where we don't belong. In short, hegemony has not been kind to the United States, and we would be better off if we weren't a world power.

Contrast this with the Japanese and Germans, who are (arguably) doing rather well for themselves. Sure, each country was broken and defeated at the end of the war, and it took a very long time for them to recover, but they came out better. I say they came out better because neither the Japanese nor Germany have the 'obligation' to police the world. In fact, both countries forbid themselves from taking offensive military action. While these countries can be (and often are) considered 'western', and are sometimes the target of anti-western hate, they are not widely hated like the United States, and are not tasked with maintaining ridiculous global military presence. Rather (and forgive me for oversimplifying), Germany can focus on Germany and Japan can focus on Japan. One need not look long to find a wealth of statistics to indicate that these two nations have far superior social safety nets, education, healthcare, etc. than the United States. While this superiority can, of course, be attributed to a wide variety of factors, I believe that one cannot ignore the important fact that these nations have their priorities straight, having suffered the shame of defeat, having gone through the experience of rebuilding and being free of any expectation of global military prowess.

What really solidifies this belief for me is the existence of universal health care in most of western Europe. I apologize that I don't have the source, but if I remember correctly, I remember watching an interview with a worker in the UK's NHS, who attributed the success of socialized medicine in Europe (versus the US) to the fact that Europe had to rebuild after World War II. Effectively, when you have to start from scratch and pick your life up from the rubble, there's a greater sense of common bond with the rest of your nation. The US, having not been hurt in the war in the same way, never had to rebuild and instead developed a more violently individualistic character, where the idea of potentially paying for someone else's health care is utterly repulsive. Americans, by virtue of having won World War II without civilian casualty, has ended up with a far worse society than those who 'lost'. If that's the case, aren't we the real losers?

Sorry if this post got long. Please, CMV!

"First of all, I want to first express how happy I am with this subreddit. It has always been a hub for civilized discussion on complicated and difficult topics. I have never witnessed uncivilized discussion on here before and I'm glad to be a part of the community. Good job, Reddit!

With that said, if you are unfamiliar with the sexual revolution I am referring to, this is a time beginning in the 1960s where people experienced an ""urge to 'find oneself'"" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution)). During this time, lots of previously taboo'd sexually related acts, ideals, etc entered into society and have more recently, at the end of the 20th century have thoroughly integrated themselves into it. This involves a large variety of things including but not limited to: proliferation and normalization of pornography, sex before marriage, acceptance of sexually explicit movie/television material, contraceptions, and the LGBT movement.

For example, pornography, which was formerly unheard of in public conversation is now often not only discussed, but glorified and upheld as a great thing. This is just one example of what I am talking about. *I am not arguing the moralities of pornography however.*

**My argument: **The recent decision by the Supreme Court to rule in favor of gay marriage is simply the next step in the sexual revolution and essentially negates some of the arguments against the next step after this; I am specifically referring to  incestuous relationships, and other ways of ""loving"" someone. However, I will mainly refer to incest for the sake of a shorter discussion.

* One of the main arguments against gay marriage is that it is ""unnatural"". One could also argue that incest is unnatural, but even more broadly, any sexual relationship outside of marriage between a man and woman can be argued effectively as unnatural.

* Gay marriage activists very frequently champion progressive thinking and non-discrimination as basis for legalizing gay marriage. The term progressive is very open for interpretation, but eliminating discrimination is very straight forward. If someone named Cercei loves her brother named Jamie, should it be allowed? Should they be allowed to marry and procreate? Incestuous relationships very often breed deformities and retardations in children; should these children be forced to have an incomplete, handicapped life on the basis of equality. *For more information on incest please view this very informative [documentary](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068473/).*

* Another argument against gay marriage has frequently been that it further inhibits the ability for the human race to procreate. This is fairly obvious as to why people say this: a man and a man cannot bear a child and vice versa. However, the same argument stands for incest; in fact, it is worse. Incestuous relationships don't further the human species, but rather they turn it backwards by corrupting genes and eliminating diversity. Also, as previously stated, incest often results in retardation in the resulting child.

With gay marriage legalized officially, these arguments become unsubstantial and hypocritical to argue with against incest.

**In conclusion, my fear is that the sexual revolution has the potential to continue to progress and eventually today's taboos will become everyday occurrences all on the basis of equality and non-discrimination.** This has the potential to effect humans on not only a genetic level by potentially allowing incest to corrupt human genetic material and cause genetic disorders, but also on a societal level where humans become more concerned with catering to someones sexual identity/preference rather than the actual person inside. I believe this could be devastating to humans. I don't claim to know what would happen, but it isn't too difficult to come up with a worst-case scenario of what society could become when the main focus of peoples interactions is politically correctness, being non-offensive, and catering to every form of person on a sexual basis.

Please feel free to ask questions and I will be happy to clarify.

CMV,
Tresky

*Disclaimer: I am in no way attempting to say that gay marriage in and of itself is causing the downfall of humanity and am not attempting to demonize or put-down members of the LGBT community. I am merely making a case of a path that humanity could potentially be (and I now believe is) on that leads to a corrupt and evil society.*

"To start: **I am *not* saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing.**

However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there's some psychological affliction behind it, but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well, but psychologists realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course, any religious objections are right out.

So with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled, I'm left without any good reason why siblings should marry each other. CMV

Edit 2: Stepping away for a bit. I'll be back in a few hours. (8:45pm, GMT)

Edit 3:
Deltas awarded to:
/u/SquirrelPower for pointing out that there is a legal difference between types of classes. /u/the-friendzoner made a similar argument, that the sexual attraction of incest is different than an orientation. 

I don't consider these sufficient reasons to continue the ban, but they are distinct from the reasons given for banning homosexuality, so they fulfill the terms of my post.

"I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking ""Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery.""

* Using chopsticks is at best a cultural exercise of contortion.

* Forks and knifes are superior in every way I can imagine &amp; in every situation.

Including :

* rice that is sticky and particularly rice that isn't sticky.

* versatility while eating different kinds of food

* eating with manners

* not having to fear the dreaded fall of food

I hope some of you will be able to help me find arguments to coerce me into using those chopsticks :)


-----------

**Update**

Some facts I've accepted regarding the chopsticks:

&amp;nbsp;

* Exercise fine motor skills

* Give time to taste the food and appreciate it

* Can be used while doing other things

* Are easier to clean, produce and carry

&amp;nbsp;

* Are superior if you want to:
 
 * Preserve the integrity of the food you eat (If you don't want to break a grapevine until it's in your mouth)

 * Eat crusty things (popcorns, cheetos, peanuts...) without dirtying your hands

 * Eat leafs or salad

&amp;nbsp;

* You can have makeshift chopsticks easily while makeshift knifes and forks are still not a thing in 2015.

* Historically better at not stabbing your enemy during dinner?

* Let this be noted, the spoon and the spork were proposed and I'm all in their favors! As for the sporfe, knifoon
and spooned knork I'm more dubious.

&amp;nbsp;

*All of this may be quite situational but in those situations I accept chopsticks as superior*.

"A friend and I were talking about the current candidates and she couldn't understand why Trump was doing so well in the polls.

I see an argument for why he may not have a good chance in an election (delta awarded), mainly in that whatever percentage of his 25% popularity is republican is all he may get from the republicans, and as a more mainstream candidate arises, the split votes wont go to him (that is, the people who polled for him may be all that would poll for him in the primary, given any other more mainstream republican candidate.

However, I have seen no compelling argument for why he is not a populist candidate.  Some have tried to narrow the definition of a populist to being representative of a position or policies that in some fashion clearly serve the underserve or/and the majority, but this is difficult to define, and ignores the perception.  One person argued at length that the self perception of the constituency as victim and the candidate's policy being to address that sense of victimization is what makes them populist, and while I can agree that it is a fine definition, the person then asserts that this is not trump, and I disagree, as Trump clearly paints the American people as victimized by poor, self interested leadership, a corrupt political culture, and compromised ideas and strategies, and his entire platform is about going in as a normal private citizen and fixing it.

Many (most?) have simply tried to argue that he is too insulting to win, but I remain unconvinced that that would stop a sizable percentage of Americans from voting for him.  This is because Americans don't actually value formality and decorum as much as power and conviction.  For the same reason that this is the America we have, I can't see how a candidate, fundamentally in favor of current nationalist policies, but simultaneously harping on being free from big money interests and the many leadership deficits that are frustrating Americans, isn't hitting so many of the right cords with mainstream America.

If he sticks to a policy (rather than sentiment,) that is antithetical to a group, then another would be preferred by that group.  But a career politician vs Trump, both speaking in vagaries, I see Trump coming out on top rather consistently.  (Saw a headline today, Trump took a hit in polls for being in favor of higher taxes, this looks like an example of the very thing.)

"Greetings!

I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay.

However, as far as my understanding of History goes, Humanity kept uniting into bigger and bigger groups.

I'm not sure whether my order is correct, but it's merely to give an example of what I am seeing.

First, families started working together as it was easier to hunt that way  
Then, they started to form small tribal communities  
Then, these tribal communities united into alliances and ""great tribes""  
Then, the tribes became petty kingdoms  
Then, the petty kingdoms were either swallowed by a larger one, or swallowed the smaller ones.  
Then, the kingdoms they formed kept absorbing the smaller communities that were similar in culture

And then there are countries like the United States and Russia, both spanning almost entire continents or more. Likewise, they have the strongest presence as well. The United Kingdom had an equally great presence during its Imperial days, which it more or less managed to retain.

I feel Europe could easily raise its economy to the third power if each current country paid its tax to a single, central government that viewed each part of the union equally, at most... with different strategies, investiture focuses.

The main counter arguement I see against an united Europe is cultural decay or incompatibility, but I do not understand how it would get in the way too much. Culture won't disappear just because people answer to a single elected government, neither will it disappear due to people wandering within the borders.

First, the economic angle. The economies of Europe are vastly different in output. Germany is an economic powerhouse. Greece can't pay its debts. Most of the rest are somewhere in the middle.

"If movies and video games are subject to regulation and censorship, then books should be too.

In many places, especially in western cultures, the censorship of books is looked down upon. Many consider it a restriction of free speech and ideas. But why do people get upset with the censorship of books, and not movies or video games?
If you are under the age of 17, you are not allowed to see a rated “R” movie without a parent. But you are allowed to go to a bookstore and buy any book you want, no matter how controversial the subject matter. Why is it okay to censor movies and not books? Like books, movies contain ideas, messages, and provoke thought and conversation. I have seen movies that have changed my way of thinking. Most of those movies are rated “R”. How is it fair to restrict teenagers from experiencing the stories and ideas of this particular medium, while allowing those same stories and ideas through literature?

The same thing goes for video games. There are video games that have been banned from western countries because of content. Oftentimes, game developers have been forced to edit the content in games (depict less blood or sexuality) in order to legally sell their product in a country. This is censorship, plain and simple. They are banning art and ideas because they are controversial and make people uncomfortable. Could you imagine what would happen if we did this with books? Banned them unless the author edited, rewrote, or removed certain scenes? There would be an uproar.

Here is a list of some video games that have either been censored or banned in certain countries:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regionally_censored_video_games[1]

Some people might argue that we are stricter with movies and video games because you can actually see the violence rather than just reading about it. But I don’t really buy this argument. In high school, I had to read “The Sorrow of War” by Bao Ninh. For those of you who haven’t read it, the book is extremely graphic and violent. There were vivid descriptions of people stabling and shooting each other in the face, tanks running over and crushing bodies, and torture. One of the main characters is raped in graphic detail. Profanities, including words like “Fuck” “Shit” and “Cunt” are everywhere. The fact that a 16 year old is allowed and encouraged to read this book, while at the same time banned from watching 22 Jump Street in theaters alone (a movie that is rated R solely because of the language”), is baffling.

To be clear, I do not agree with regulation and censorship at all. But since we enforce it on games and movies, I think that books should be held to the same standard. CMV.","I think there's an important distinction between age limits and outright censorship.  ""Censorship"" in the political sense means that you are suppressing or editing a book, movie, or another work on the basis of the words and ideas contained inside it being deemed ""unacceptable"" by some authority figure.  The problem with censorship is that it abridges the freedom of adults to choose the media they consume and to expose themselves to whatever content they want.  


MPAA and RIAA ratings, on the other hand, are age limits that apply only to children under 17.  They aren't removing these movies or video games from the marketplace of ideas, or even preventing children from seeing them.  They are just giving parents the choice about whether to expose their children to those media, rather than allowing children to have that choice themselves.  Rightly or wrongly, children under the age of 17 are under the guardianship of their parents, and our society and our legal system gives parents to make certain choices on behalf of their children until they reach a certain age.  You can argue that age 17 is arbitrary, but I think most people would agree that children below SOME age are not really capable of deciding themselves what media is appropriate to consume.  So then it's just a question of picking where the arbitrary age cutoff is.


Age limits on books are actually quite common.  It is illegal for example, to sell erotica to children, and many bookstore chains have also adopted their own content limits in terms of what books they'll sell to young kids.  Parent groups and others will often force schools and libraries to ban certain titles (or to remove them from school curricula) for putative ""graphic content"" or political controversy.  Morally, this doesn't seem to me much different from the MPAA/RIAA rating systems; the only real difference is that it's done on an ad-hoc basis at the consumer level, rather than nationally by an industry-wide board.


Also, I agree with u/forestfly1234 that the layer of interpretation needed to understand graphic content in books provides another layer of protection (generally, in my experience as a teacher, kids who are old enough to understand what they're reading are usually old enough to handle the content, and the same is definitely not true of movies.)","If you're reading a book you have to interpret what you're reading. If you a six year old read a rape scene and have no idea what a rape scene actually entails you're probably going to not really understand what that scene is trying to depict. 

The kid is protected by not having any idea as to what he is reading, so the rape scene has no context for him. He probably is protected because he can't read the thing in the first place. Books provide protection that movies and games don't.

If I show the movie Hostel to a 6 year old the violence is already really dedicated for him. That kid just has to sit back and watch. he isn't protected by his ignorance. Everything is just laid out to see.

"     Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. I can't believe rappers are allowed to win grammies and different music awards. Poets should be allowed to win grammies too then. Rap to me is like in the same category as a terrible singer sometimes. 

     Every person on this earth that can speak is capable of rapping. You can't say the same for singers, that can sing on key. You might say, it takes skill to rap well. No it doesn't. It takes time, and a pen and paper. It can be mastered relatively easy. Please show me why they deserve to be respected as musicians.

Edit 1: Okay u/scottevil110 pointed out to me, performing, or the entertainment value is a big part of a rappers act. It takes tremendous confidence and talent to get on stage and move a crowd with your lyrics. Some rappers are capable of this so, i changed my view that some have talent in that regard, but as far as the actual rapping i still believe that i could truthfully be the next Meek, or Young Thug.

Edit 2: Let me clarify what talent is to me. I already know what the webster definition is, the natural ability or aptitude to do something. Let's take young thug as an example and Lamarr. They're both rappers and make good music i like. Everyone who can talk has the ability to come up with the words young thug says, and say it like him in a drunken stupor. So everyone is talented then in some way. Lamar it would take longer, and he has a nice flow, but still it could be easily copied. Now, REAL talent to me, is a perormance like Keyshia Cole singing [Love](  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KTkW636B8xg) one of the greatest songs of all time. Or Peter Green ripping the shit out of a guitar, in songs like, need your love so bad, or [the supernatural](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YoasUjXBkm8_____). That's REAL talent, compared to something like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RAzzv6Ks9nc). REAL talent is something that not your average jor could do. Some are born with it. For some it takes years to become good at it, but it has to have a level of difficulty, in my view, that the average person can't easily attain.

Edit 3: u/glory2hypnotoad showed me writing a full length album on Eminems level does take i guess some real skill. So there are a few rappers who have some real talent. But generally they are untalented. However every singer that can sing on key is talented to me. It's just in a whole 'nother caliber of music to me, for the simple reason it's next to impossible to attain. Comparing Eminem to any singer that can sing on key, is like comparing Iman Shumpert to Lebron James.

"A political party leader has a duty to serve their country via their government or via their opposition (if they have not won election to government).

Losing an election does not prevent a good leader from leading, it merely humbles them, but losing an election will cause a bad leader to give up.

In the UK 3 major political party leaders gave up on Friday when they should be using their leadership skills and good vision to lead the opposition to keep the government accountable. If they had won the election I presume that they would not have retired. which makes it very evident that the leaders of the losing parties did not have leadership skills and/or a good vision but merely wanted to win for the sake of power.

"So I'll start off by saying that in no way am I promoting the ""gluten free diet"" or any other so called ""fad"" diets such as paleo, keto etc...
Essentially my viewpoint is that making fun of, or telling an individual who chooses to follow these diets that they are naïve and trying to convince them not to follow them is just as bad as making fun of, or saying the same things to a religious individual, such as a Muslim or Jew who cannot eat pork or must eat halal, or kosher food.
In both instances there is no general scientific consensus that agrees with the choices the individuals make; however, in both cases the individuals feel good about their choices whether it be because they feel like they are following the will of their God, or because they believe they are eating healthier. I do make an exception for diets which are unsustainable and will eventually cause either malnutrition or an eating disorder etc… but some diets, such as gluten free or dairy free, do not cause this issue, and the individuals feel great when they do it, whether or not it is a placebo or a result of other factors is irrelevant. I see a lot of hate on people who follow these diets on the internet and in person and I don’t really understand why. If the individuals is an adult and chooses to practice this lifestyle we should respect it as much as we respect individuals who practice their religions. In both cases I agree that if they shove it in people’s faces and try to convert people they know, it is annoying, but if they keep to themselves and understand that it is not for everyone, I don't see a reason for all the hate on people who follow these lifestyles.

"What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy the idea undermines, and they have no bearing on truth, which should be the only thing that determines the believability of an idea.

Here is an example of a true racist idea: ice age adaptations make caucasians less athletic than black people. It's mainly noticeable at the extremes: the best black athletes are better than the best white athletes. I should believe this idea because evidence supports it, and not be afraid of the power dynamics it may disrupt. That is *intellectual integrity*.

I think it's naive to say truth is the *only* thing that every matters about a statement. Honesty is a good policy because we cannot function without trust. But truth functions as a weapon just as much as misinformation. It is a true fact that black people have lower IQs than white people. Stating this fact without context (the fact that IQ correlates with environment and social class, the subsequent discussion about why African Americans tend to be in a lower social class due to the effects of American history and why this is almost certainly not genetic, the fact that IQ tests are biased in favor of the life experiences of the writers, the fact that a reverse Pygmalion effect exists racially, the fact that race as we use it is a social construct and that generalizations over race are basically meaningless the way most people use them, and so on) ends up having a sociopolitical effect anyway.

I think I agree mostly, but the way humans tend to process generalized information, unless you're very precise with the idea you run the risk of, by holding a true and honest idea in your mind, carrying and perpetuating a false *impression* resulting from that idea.

&gt;Here is an example of a true racist idea: ice age adaptations make caucasians less athletic than black people. It's mainly noticeable at the extremes: the best black athletes are better than the best white athletes.

It's *only* noticeable at the extremes. In the NFL, for example, 68% of players are black vs. 17% of the U.S. population. At the collegiate level black athletes are about 45% of the player population, and at the high school level the ratios are even less skewed.

In other sports, however, it's not really as clear or precise as you say. For example, Kenyans (specifically a particular tribe of Kenyans) dominate marathons, but you don't see them dominating in the NFL, do you? Or look in international football (soccer) competitions... the German world cup team (a bunch of whiteys) has done pretty well over the years, with tons of championships. Other national teams have also shown excellence, despite a lack of black athletes. The phrase ""less athletic"" is such a coarse generalization that it might give you the impression that white players cannot be competitive at the highest level, or that in the median competitive range (where most actual people would exist) that it's not close enough as to be ignorable. By perpetuating that unqualified general idea (even if in some sense correct) you're risking perpetuating a lot of related specific ideas that are false.

And for ideas that are *false*, don't you think that a false idea that causes suffering is worse than a false idea that causes no suffering or at least causes less suffering? If so, then presenting a true general idea that carries with it associated false and harmful ideas, should be undertaken much more cautiously than a true general idea that has little associated downside, shouldn't it?",350,"&gt;What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc.

"Now in the spirit of fairness - I believe this to be true for all governments, but in this case I'll touch upon the U.S. gov.

First of all [Lusatania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania#Undeclared_war_munitions) the U.S. government deliberately loaded a civilian ship with munitions, so that the German can sink it and the population be dragged into a war they wanted nothing to do with.

Second - [Gulf of Tonkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident#Later_statements_about_the_incident) where the government lied about  engaging enemy targets, in order to stimulate the population into supporting the Vietnam War. 

Third - [Nayirah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah) testified before congress to encourage U.S. into entering the Gulf War

Forth - [MKUltra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra) is a thing.

After this, how can anyone trust the government in any way? It's insane to give it more power.   ","First, you said that ""this is true for all governments,"" meaning, I suppose, that you believe every government body is untrustworthy.  Since systems of government vary so wildly from country to country, from parliamentary democracies to theocracies to dictatorships, it can't be a specific form or kind of governance that you identify as the source of this problem, so that suggests you find a kind of illegitimacy in government by definition.  In other words, no government is capable of behaving in a way that you deem ""trustworthy"" because there is something inherently untrustworthy about the idea of government.

In order to address that concept, we have to agree about what sort of trustworthiness we're talking about, and since you repeatedly link the two, how this trustworthiness relates to the concept of government power.  It sounds to me like you are talking about the trust that a nation's citizens should be able to place in their government, which sounds reminiscent of the idea of the [social contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) that supposedly exists between a government and the governed, a tacit agreement that citizens cede some power to a central authority in exchange for some benefits, such as national security, economic protection, and the general pursuit of the nation's interests above others.  Now, we can't argue here about some forms of the social contract being better or more legitimate than others--this isn't going to turn into a Hobbes vs. Rousseau debate--because you've already stated that you believe every government is ""untrustworthy,"" which I'm here parsing as ""unable or unwilling to fulfill its end of the social contract.""   

Now, I get the feeling that maybe this isn't so much about the social contract stuff at all.  As far as upholding its agreement to pursue its own citizens' interests above all others, it's arguable that the United States was doing just that even while committing the acts you've described.  This sounds more like a criticism of the opacity of our government--that sometimes it willfully misleads its citizens, that we're being manipulated, propagandized, and lied to by our government.  Here, I would concede that this is true, to some extent, of all governments: that sometimes, in order to maintain its legitimacy or increase popular support for what it feels to be the best course of action, every government uses ""spin"" to push forward certain agendas.  This is true both in modern democracies and in medieval feudal systems, because the government, if it wishes to last, needs its citizens to at least believe it is acting with real authority.  You might counter that, if the government needs people to trust its legitimacy, the best way to do that is to be entirely honest with them, and that's a great idea in theory, but in practice, a number of obstacles prevent this.  For one, different parts of the government need to have access to information that, in order to truly protect the interest of its citizens, must be held to the utmost secrecy.  The CIA can't let the media know every time it's started to hunt down a suspected espionage scheme, the FBI can't announce publicly that they're tracking the movements of a terrorist cell, the IRS can't broadcast that they suspect a large company has committed fraud before they have proof.  Certain vital functions of the government would cease to work entirely if forced to be transparent, and would in fact become counterproductive to the well-being of the nation.  It's true that these more covert aspects of government function can be used as a smokescreen by unscrupulous individuals or interests, but that's not *why* they exist.

Another scenario where obfuscation often arises is more in line with the events you mention as examples of government untrustworthiness.  Sometimes, the government needs popular support for a course of action it wants to pursue, but knows that the cause won't get that support on its own, so it manufactures a casus belli.  But why, in these cases, did the government's opinion of the best course of action diverge from the public's?  Often the problem is that the political framework of experts just doesn't translate to everyday people, who wouldn't accept the political reality of our world even when it is explained to them.  To use your WWI example, with hindsight it is easy to condemn the whole of WWI as a pointless, needlessly brutal war that never should have been fought, but imagine you're in the position of America after Europe has already entered into the war.  Now that many of your allies and trade interests are engaged in this conflict, it's going to affect you to one degree or another.  There are a huge range of motivations for American exceptionalism, from pacifism to xenophobia, but there are also motivations for entering the war.  One, it will improve the odds that the side your support actually succeeds, and it bolsters your relationship with your allies and to some extent, makes them indebted to you.  Two, it might hasten the end of the conflict, which could be considered a humanitarian win--even though your entering the fray will certainly result in some suffering and loss of life that otherwise would not have happened, it might mean less suffering and loss of life *overall*.  Three, war is generally good for the home economy, as it stimulates spending and development in many industries.  Also, at the time, there was a certain interest in both increasing US influence abroad and hopefully preventing future conflicts by starting an international peacekeeping force, which America could legitimately present only if they'd had a dog in the fight.  But these reasons are very big-picture, dry, and long-term, and everyday citizens often don't respond well to reasons like this.  They don't have the education or background, many times, to consider these arguments fairly.  What they respond to much more is overt patriotic overtures, emotional displays, and singular catalyzing events as the spurs for action.  This is why nations manufacture events like the Lusitania as a casus belli.  Also I should point out that your summary of that event is not in line with the link you provided--the conspiracy theory states that the **British** purposefully allowed the Germans to destroy the ship in order to bring the US into the war, but regardless, since the Lusitania sank in 1915 and the US didn't enter the war until 1917, its use as a rallying point for US engagement can still be seen as propagandizing rather than a legitimate primary motivation for the US entering the war.

Now, we have to address what you mean by ""giving the government more power,"" but I'm going to break this into two parts because this has turned into a really long comment...","I'll agree that the government has proven itself untrustworthy multiple times, but it also can be counted on for certain things.

&gt; #1 Boredom is the default mood. Mere existence isn't enough to satisfy us, we constantly have to distract ourselves from boredom.

I disagree. Humans are pack animals. If you are with your ""clan"" (friends, family, etc), you should not be bored. Most humans find enjoyment simply from being around people they like. If you do not, then you are in the minority. If you are alone, then you will feel boredom. This is because humans are not meant to be secluded.

&gt; #2 Pleasure requires effort, suffering does not. I literally don't have to do anything to suffer from boredom and starvation.

I disagree as well. For me, pleasure comes easily. I will talk to a stranger and get pleasure, listen to a song and get pleasure, eat a nice meal and get pleasure. There isn't much effort I'm putting in. When I'm not putting in effort, I don't feel suffering. If you have a good 2-3 hours of pleasure, 1-2 hours of alone-time shouldn't make you fail pain. Food is also easy to come by nowadays and is in abundance. That's not an issue, so it's worthless to discuss.

&gt; #3 Suffering is more powerful feeling than pleasure. Is there an opposite to a cluster headache

In my opinion, you underrate pleasure. If your mother dies, you feel immense suffering. That's not because the value of human life weighs so much on your soul that you can't bare to see a person die. It's because of the all the pleasure that person brought you. You feel pain, because you miss the pleasure.

It's the same thing with a cluster headache. You underrate the good feeling of having a clear head and feeling ""normal"". Cluster headaches hurt so much because normal feelings are so good. With normal feelings in your head, you can come up with amazing ideas, formulas, etc that make you feel immense joy. You take that for granted.

&gt; #4 The universe doesn't care about how we feel. No one is protecting us. If I'm falling onto spikes, universe is not gonna pull me away and protect me, no matter how hard I pray.

The universe is not some sentient being with feelings. Saying that the universe doesn't care about you falling onto spikes is the same as saying the playground didn't care that you broke your arm while on the slide. The universe doesn't have feelings. Dying is a part of life. It is the equal to birth. Birth is the best thing that can happen to you and death is the worst. Sure, you could wish you were never alive to have never felt suffering, but at the same time, you would never have felt joy.

"In the early 90s Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved in the ""Velvet Divorce"" into two separate countries: the Czech Republic and Slovakia. I like that they split the name evenly as well.  They divided the national assets by population and want their respective ways.  While there have been some hiccups, by and large both countries are doing fine. 

I think America should undergo a Velvet Divorce of its own.  First the how, then the why. I'd like to focus on why it's a worse outcome than the current course of the country, rather than on the problems with execution (which are admittedly huge).

The How:
Each political party designs a policy platform for their own country.  Everyone votes in a ""primary"" referendum for the various platforms, and the two platforms with the most votes advance to the general referendum. Based on the current U.S. political situation, Democratic and Republican platforms are likely to win top-two. (If we want to do more, we can, but it seems like 3rd parties would still benefit)

In the general referendum, every state holds a vote between the two platforms. The majority decides which country the state will join. 

The likely countries we'll call the ""United States"" and ""America"". These are short-hand for the more liberal/Democratic country and the more conservative/Republican country, respectively. They're likely to look somewhat similar to the last few presidential elections, though with perhaps some defectors in either direction, depending on which country the states see as the real successor to the USA. 

For five years, the government plans and executes the division of itself, the national assets, and national debts by population.  Anyone who wants to move from an area that will be in one country, to an area that will
be in the other, will receive government assistance to move.  (I would predict an exodus of African-Americans from ""America"")

At the end of the five years, the USA is dissolved, its citizenship, currency, flag retired and replaced by those of its successor states. 

The Why:
It's apparent to even casual observers of American politics that The USA is a nation divided, mired in gridlock. The result is a non-functional government in which no one is satisfied and major policy initiatives are tortured into Frankensteinian monstrosities to pass (Obamacare). 

Americans have already begun to segregate themselves politically and we've seen a real deterioration of moderate politicians in both parties, who normally could help bridge the gap and find compromises.  

This stagnation is hurting the USA both at home and abroad. Significant domestic policy challenges are going unaddressed on the federal level (climate change, loss of the middle class, deterioration of transportation infrastructure, tax reform, cost of higher education) and as a result, the USA is losing ground against other countries economically. 

So instead of constantly tripping over each other, screwing up each other's plans, etc, why not divorce?  The ""United States"" can try every left-wing wacko policy it wants, ""America"" can finally do all the nutbag conservative things it wants, and in thirty years, we see which country is the better for it?  Could it really be worse than the partisan gridlock that is dragging the USA down?

Problems with this idea:
There are a lot, so I'll highlight some big ones on the procedure side and the effect side. 

Military:  Each nation would be nuclear-capable and have procedures and armaments the other side is familiar with. This means duplication of key assets (two NORADs, two Pentagons) and that new procedures will have to be developed to ensure neither has the advantage over the other. The ""United States"" might also suffer significance military brain drain to ""America"" due to the average political inclinations of service members. 

World Economy:  The world economy would go into recession as the world's biggest economy divides and both countries struggle with the inherent inefficiency of two economies where there was one.  Especially if either side enacts trade barriers to the other. 

Race to the bottom:  ""America"" would probably remove or reduce labor, environmental, and health and safety laws that are considered bad for business, making it more attractive for capital investment.  This would undermine the ""United States""economy and progressive policies, as companies can get the same workers for cheaper. 

Geography:
""America"" would be continuous and vaguely similar to the Republican ""L"" of the south and midwest, with the ""United States"" split between the west coast and northeast.  This is not conducive to the survival of the ""United States"" as an intact entity, I'm not sure there's a nation that's been divided into two parts that has survived very long. ","&gt;  At the end of the five years, the USA is dissolved, its citizenship, currency, flag retired and replaced by those of its successor states.

You've glossed over the absolute biggest deal breaker on the list.  US currency is not measured by a gold standard.  Our currency is based on speculation.  That speculation is almost entirely based on a name/reputation. If the country is dissolved, the currency is reevaluated again.  Upon reevaluation it is impossible for it to divide into even halves.  The different parts synergize to create a result greater than the sum of it's parts.  The division would result in a plummet in both economies.","The problem is that we aren't divided on a nice and neat state level. Have you seen the [Purple America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_America) map? You can have liberal districts (often but not always containing cities) inside of states that strongly disagree with them, or conservative districts (often but not always more rural) inside states that are seen as liberal, and even beyond that things can be close (shades of purple instead of bright red and blue).

So for example Northwest Oregon would want to be part of the ""United States,"" but as soon as you get outside of the Multonomah/Clackamas region and Lane county the state would probably want to be ""America."" This is pretty common throughout the country, with bastions of one side or the other even inside ""strongholds."" What determines how the state goes isn't geographic, but based on how large the populations of the two parts happen to be. The same goes for a county.

If we are dividing at the state level they will end up in the wrong ones, and after some adjustment likely get back to the sort of gridlock we have. If you divide at the district level you will have a total mess, with enclaves surrounded by other countries and going back and forth between two countries ever county line!

So while the current situation might be far from ideal, break wouldn't even be as clean as many of the country breakups have been in the past along historic/ethnic lines that have a strong geographic element.

"Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to accept a lot of things...

I'm having trouble understanding what exactly your view is, as I'm sure you'll understand seeing as you acknowledged that it's rather vague and complicated. But your use of the word 'spiritual' is intriguing and I think that might be where the 'problem' (if I can use that word) with your view is.

Your use of 'spiritual' seems to imply that you see gender (as opposed to biological sex, although I disagree with that distinction for other reasons) as a *metaphysical* concept. This isn't the case, at least in most academic circles: it's a *social* concept. 

You seem to have empiricist leanings, but I feel like you've taken that a step beyond what is reasonable: although there is something inherently anti-empirical about metaphysical or spiritual claims, and so an empiricist would be sceptical of them, you've extended this scepticism to all non-physical claims, which isn't reasonable since there's clearly plenty of social and mental phenomena which are empirical but not physical. Take art, for instance. It's pretty clear that there is no essential physical property to what we call 'art', but that doesn't mean we can't study art and make objective statements about art beyond its physical attributes (we can talk about the role of art in society, or the history of art, or what art is influential etc.)

Art, then, is clearly an abstract concept in that it's not a physical concept. This doesn't make it 'not real', though. Do you see how there's a parallel with gender there? Or have I missed your view/this doesn't actually touch on what I assumed you were assuming?

Alright, so, i was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while i am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, i will only do so if you can actually change my mind. I will not give up easily.
I believe I can change this country, better yet, this world for the better. The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution. Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly. We save the weak. I personally believe that we should execute the weak. yes, this sounds harsh but let me explain why. We are not advancing as a race. For now though, we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on. Another massive problem we are facing is over population, we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates.
You look at animals and if an animal doesn't want to eat, it dies, if a human doesn't want to eat, it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder. More importantly that human is allowed to procreate. We allow shitty genetics to be passed on. We SAVE the WEAK. We also allow these morbidly obese, incredibly stupid people live and breed. If an animal in the wild isn't fit, or cannot attract a mate, it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics. Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children, which fucks with the gene pool. I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary i'll continue on later.
Now to determine who is to be executed. The type of people i want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society. If you weigh 500 pounds but you're incredibly smart, you can still make a contribution to society. The opposite is also true, if you're borderline retarded but you're very physically fit, you can also contribute to society. People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn't want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating.
What will determine who is executed: At the age of 14 years old, annual testing will begin based on birthday. There will be three tests, a mental test, a physical test, and a psychological test. Your Mental test exactly 3 months after your birthday and your physical test 9 months after your birthday. Tests will vary depending on your age, the older you get the harder they become, until the age of 20 where they will remain the same until 35 and gradually work their way down until the age of 65 where no further testing will be required. At the age of 20 we will also introduce psychological testing which will continue until the age of 65.
What the tests will consist of: The mental test will be a basic evaluation of your ability to do math, your ability to read and write, and your basic understanding of the sciences. This test should not be difficult, anyone who has at least a D average in school should be just fine. For the physical test, every age group will be required to complete a mile in 16 minutes. This is a very easy time to make, you can walk that pace. Physical tests will include varying push up or sit up tests depending on age group. There may be a few other exercises required in certain age groups, and the amount of repetitions will also vary depending on age. this should be easy for anyone who isn't morbidly obese. Next is the psychological test. These will be administered every 5 years to insure mental stability and health of everyone. We want the mental health of our gene pool to be good as well. Lastly, there will be certain ways to be omitted to testing, ALL WILL BE FROM SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY, the main one being in the military. If you served in the military without being dishonorably discharged, you will be exempt from any further testing in your lifetime. Another example of a way to be omitted from testing is by paying for it. The cost will be $25,000 per year, per person. Many will be angry that it's giving more power to the rich, but i see it as a valid way of determining someones potential for making a contribution to society. If you are rich, I will almost guarantee you are either physically fit enough or mentally fit enough to pass the tests and you would have been fine anyway. AN IMPORTANT NOTE: You will only have to pass 2 out of 3 tests.
How we will execute people: We will set up an organization in charge of carrying out testing and executing people. My idea is to possibly have the military be in charge of this, though I haven't had the time to think too much into that, this I am very open to other ideas on. The method of execution i think will be best is the firing squad. 8 men, 2 with real bullets to ensure death, 6 with blanks for the obvious reason. For those who are unaware, my understanding is that firing squads use primarily blanks so the gunmen aren't aware of who actually killed the person so they don't have trouble with living life after killing someone.
Now another thing i would like to do that isn't executing people, but will improve our gene pool is preventing certain people from having children. People with MORE THAN two generations of diagnosed cancer or potentially terminal illnesses that tend to be passed on genetically will be sterilized. These people will not be allowed to produce offspring, however we will make it easy for them to adopt if they would like to have children.
I would also like to place a limit on the amount of children a person may have. The maximum number of children a person may have is 3, which is a very reasonable amount. It should slow the rate of population increase or possibly make the population decrease due to some couples not having children or only having 1 child. There is no reason to have more than 3 children because at that point you're just putting a burden on society. If say you already have 2 children and you would like to have a third but you end up with twins, triplets, or even more, you will be allowed to keep them as it wasn't your intent to have that many. When you hit the limit for children you will be sterilized.
This is all i can think of for now, if i remember more of my plan i will post. So reddit users, change my view.","I could write two dozen things in opposition to this, but just to gather a few basic points.

-You should understand, if you don't(seems like you don't), that what you're referring is [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics), a field of thought that has existed for about as long as Darwin's theory of evolution has has a long, *very* sordid history.  Most notably, it was one of the primary justifications for Nazi Germany's genocidal practices.

-Despite it's attractiveness to certain political persuasions, [overpopulation is simply not a concern with legitimate scientific backing](https://www.pop.org/content/debunking-myth-overpopulation).  In fact, if the world continues to increase on its path of modernization, democratization and secularism, *under*population is the issue we will have to be concerned.  In highly educated, relatively prosperous societies, birth rates become lower and lower, to the point where they are now beginning to become lower than death rates in some places.  In America, if you excluded immigration, the population would not be growing.  In Japan, it's shrinking and aging outright.  It's only because of the poorer places in the world that population continues to grow substantially, and even then, the worldwide birth rate is shrinking slowly every year.

-You should understand, if you don't(seems like you don't), that what you're referring is [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics), a field of thought that has existed for about as long as Darwin's theory of evolution has has a long, *very* sordid history.  Most notably, it was one of the primary justifications for Nazi Germany's genocidal practices.

-Despite it's attractiveness to certain political persuasions, [overpopulation is simply not a concern with legitimate scientific backing](https://www.pop.org/content/debunking-myth-overpopulation).  In fact, if the world continues to increase on its path of modernization, democratization and secularism, *under*population is the issue we will have to be concerned.  In highly educated, relatively prosperous societies, birth rates become lower and lower, to the point where they are now beginning to become lower than death rates in some places.  In America, if you excluded immigration, the population would not be growing.  In Japan, it's shrinking and aging outright.  It's only because of the poorer places in the world that population continues to grow substantially, and even then, the worldwide birth rate is shrinking slowly every year.

"First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100% serious here; not a troll.
Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways of communication could hardly be any more different from ours. A dog leaping onto you is not expressing affection; it's literally asserting dominance. A dog dragging you by the leash is not eager to play; it's showing you who the top dog is and ordering you to follow the pack leader (itself). A dog making eye contact is, again, asserting dominance--read: not affectionately gazing into its master's eyes. The list goes on. Seems like we've anthropomorphizing our cuddly partners a bit too much. Chances are, it's probably not thinking what most people think it's thinking. A dog that looks ""depressed"" to most of us is really just an obedient dog with a responsible owner. Man's best friend? That's some grade-a bull. Man's best friend is none other than fellow man. Dogs have no capacity for logic / reasoning skills and will bark at any stranger to feel better about themselves. We don't understand them very well, and they understand us even less. They've helped our hunter-gatherer ancestors, and are still useful to people with certain disabilities today. But that makes them no more than co-workers and can hardly be considered potential friends, given our inherent differences in nature. Dog experts of reddit, I'd love to have my mind changed on this one because I literally can't look at dogs anymore without thinking they are incredibly savage and overly-hierarchical creatures undeserving of our attention.

"I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever.


 Smokers say its relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need a smoke but ran out/cant leave to smoke at the moment etc, so if it is relaxing, it also adds to stress. Not to mention it's relaxing because it's a form of self fulfilling effect. It is relaxing because their body wants those chemicals, and they are giving it to the body.


All the unhealthy effects are well known, I'm not going to list all them.


It pollutes the enviroment. All the chemicals in the smoke, and the filters... how many smokers actually throw away the cigarette butts. I am sure 95% of them just flick them on the ground... look around outside anyplace where people go on smoke breaks. They are everywhere, blowing around, getting in the water, and animals eat them.


Im sure the main counterpoint to this is going to be ""how can you or the government tell me what i can do with my body and health""...

They already do though. They pass laws all the time because they say it's for our own good. Seatbelt laws for one example. The only person you hurt by not wearing one is yourself, but they make that a law. They have laws about what toxins and chemicals can be in our bug sprays, paint, and food, so it isn't like they dont already do that.

"I don't even know where to start. 



I am generally a happy and healthy person. I was raised Catholic. I am not a strict Catholic. I enjoy the community of church. I don't take everything at face value or for fact. About 8 years ago I came to terms that there is probably no Heaven. Death is just ceasing to exist. I was okay with that. I still felt we had souls or spirits. I still hoped for or had affection for the possibility of a God, even though it probably didn't exist. I still hoped for an afterlife of some sort, even though I didn't know what it would manifest as and that the chance of one was actually quite slim. I felt my children were a blessing. Their births were the most beautiful, tender days of my life. I took joy and pride in everything my kids did. Some days I would just well up with pride and happiness, so happy that our lives have been rich and lucky. Any thoughts of death or mortality were far, far from my mind. I just didn't think about those types of things. Sure, the thoughts flitted through my mind every now and then and I would think about them. I would discuss it with my spouse. Usually I would take comfort in the intense love and happiness we have and know that no matter what happens at the end, somehow we would still go on, whether it be in the hearts or memories of others, in some type of spirit/soul that survived death, in photos or videos . . . The jury was out on what happens, but I was at least accepting or positive about it. 




Now, I feel like a shattered, empty person.




As I've gotten older, I have developed high blood pressure (family history). My doctor put me on Atenolol 50mg once a day. About four days in, I started to feel sad and question my mortality and my family's mortality out of nowhere. Things just spiraled out of control after that. I learned about nihilism, atheism, existentialism, what happens after death, that we are just computers, emotions aren't real, just by-products of brain impulses ... just lots of things I never thought about before and I became incredibly depressed. Crying everyday, scared of the eventuality of our lives, the meaningless of life, the possible lack of a soul, no proof of an afterlife ... I feel like I've been down a horribly dark rabbit hole and I want to get out.




I went back to my doctor and he said Atenolol, being a beta blocker, can cause depression, so he took me off of it. I was on it for two weeks. My last dose was about 96 hours ago. I'm not feeling much better. How long does it take the medication to get out of my system and for all my brain chemistry to start working again? I'm having a lot of trouble finding meaning in what I do, and what I do with my family since there's no point. We won't remember anything after we die. Why do I care if I get some award at work? What do I care if my kid gets in the school play? Why celebrate someone's birthday? I feel empty. I feel hollow. I do not want to feel like this.
Could this really all be a cause of the medicine? Or did I do this to myself? Will my feelings of happiness and excitement come back? Will I find meaning again? How long until I could be ""back to normal?"" 




This current depressive state is so unlike me and nothing I have ever experienced before. I'm scared I'll always have these depressing thoughts about mortality and life's meaning that I just don't want in my head anymore. I want to rewind the last two weeks and go back to my jovial, excited, proud self that I was. I want to believe in what I used to believe in. I feel like now that I've researched what really happens after death, or researched that we probably have no souls, that we are just a product of brain chemistry, that I can never go back to how I was. I WANT to, though. I feel like now that I've gotten a peek at what we really are (sophisticated computers) that I can never be happy again. I don't want to know these truths. I want to go back to how I was. I am losing meaning in anything I do.  I am becoming detatched from my children and spouse. I don't enjoy doing anything with them. It's all just a reminder that they will die someday, too. I don't want to live in a world where they don't exist, but that's where I am destined to be and it destroys me. I can't look at my kids and be happy anymore, knowing that anything we do is meaningless. Yes, I know there are the arguments that YOU have to provide meaning and make something out of the life you are given, but that doesn't help me feel better at all. It makes me feel worse. I feel like I have to work now to assign or find meaning, rather than it just naturally occurring and flowing and being part of my day-to-day life. My kid drew a picture today and happily showed me. All I could muster was a ""nice job,"" instead of my usual effortless pride and happiness in how he was developing and growing.  




Each time I try to make myself feel better, I ruin it.  I tell myself that it is possible all humans, animals have souls. I know there is no scientific proof right now (except for the Lanza theories which I am not sold on), but I feel it's possible for everyone to just have that essential spark in them. Then I feel better, but then realize that our consciousness is just our brains tricking us into thinking we are an ""I"" or we are a ""self."" That it's impossible for a soul to exist. Where in evolution would we even have developed one? What happened to all the beings in death who didn't have souls? Or were souls present in the primordial ooze we came from? See, that's just not realistic.  I look up stuff online which just confirms this bleakness. There's no hope anymore. Pre-Atenolol me wouldn't have thought these thoughts. Now I'm destroyed by them. Now I'm just thinking that every memory I make, every experience I have is for nothing. 




I just want to go back to my happy, silly, proud self. Is this all just the medicine? I want to take pride in my family again. I want the little things to become important again. I want to be carefree and hopeful again. However, I feel now that I've gotten a glimpse of the dark and painful truths of our existence that I'm going to never be able to get over this crisis, never get these thoughts out of my head, and never be happy again for the rest of my life. This terrifies me. I just want to be who I was again, but it think that's impossible. 




Please, please change my view.

The idea of us all being essentially mechanical is a thought trap. It's logically appealing due to its backing in science and empiricism and all that... the problem with it is that it does a poor job of describing us humans.

Formally speaking, a piece of music is a combination of sine waves of varying amplitude and phases. A painting is a bunch of pigments that reflect different wavelengths of light. A book is a series of symbols, and not very inventive and diverse at that. A flower produces chemical substances that excite nerves in our olfactory system. Food combines nutrients with flavours and a bunch of other things.

None of these descriptions are wrong... and that's the insidious thing about them. Life isn't about being technically right. In fact, technically right is the dullest kind of right. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing at all wrong with seeing things as they truly are. In fact, being able to see things as they truly are is an extremely valuable skill. But the idea that reality is devoid of meaning and, to borrow a word from you, sparks... that's something you've added on top, for no good reason. That's the wrong part. That's the idea you have to doubt, to be sceptical about. People don't enjoy paintings and music and books and the experience of a sunset because of a bunch of mathematical equations. People enjoy these things because of what they mean. Do you know how insanely improbable it is for us to be able to look at a sunset, and breathe, and have trees framing the view, in the first place? The probability of that possibility having come to pass is so close to zero you can't even imagine a number that small. The world can be explained in terms of formulae and scientific models, but that never needs to take away the absolute miracle that it all is. And nobody really has an explanation of how the world could come to be the way it is now.

Some people turn to religion to explain the world and the things in it. Personally I have given up on trying to explain it. I think miracles don't *need* an explanation, even though of course explanations can be useful and enlightening.

In light of all that, the fact that we can ""explain"" our subjective experience in terms of an electrochemical apparatus that does things... that's just the tiniest detail. In fact we're really quite bad at explaining how our experience arises out of electrochemical processes. We kind of understand the interaction on the cellular level, and we've identified a bunch of areas in a bunch of tissue that seem to be doing something, stuff like that. The rest is still essentially intractable to us... but that doesn't stop people from going around proclaiming ""all you are is a bunch of chemicals"". Yeah, like that is a good explanation... that's just a fragment of an explanation, really.

Perhaps some day someone is going to discover, with tools that we haven't invented yet, that our electrochemical apparatus, if replicated atom by atom, doesn't work, that something is missing. And then that day we might realize that the world isn't as entirely physical as we thought. Or maybe we'll be able to make perfect copies of humans. In the present, however, we don't know. It's just thought experiments. We can argue about it until we're blue in the face but we still won't know. Here's a hint to keep in mind when reading research: ""we found no evidence"" doesn't mean the thing they looked for doesn't exist. It just means that the methodology used by the study was not suited for finding evidence *or* maybe the thing doesn't exist. We can't really tell the difference. (Taking this point further is a different topic, see /r/philosophyofscience.)

That medication can have side effects doesn't really answer the question one way or another. The environment we find ourselves in can influence our mood quite a bit, too. For instance, I don't like walking through heavy traffic nearly as much as through, say, a forest. So you might say my mood is caused by traffic -- it's not that different from saying my mood is caused by a bunch of chemical changes, a drug perhaps. Perhaps the traffic caused me to take drugs? At some point these attempts at causal explanations become ridiculously rickety. (And, by the way, it's perfectly possible to feel good despite traffic... I'd go as far as saying it's probably possible to feel good despite the drug, but of course I can't prove that and I certainly don't have a convenient step-by-step guide.)

There's a good chance that the stuff you've taken has influenced you... but, the way I see it, it doesn't directly ""cause"" your mood and thinking and all that, and certainly taking it away isn't going to directly ""cause"" you to go back to normal. Part of that is on you... you do that part by understanding that the way you were thinking about this that got you to write your post is not formally incorrect, but also just a tiny part of the real story that you've been forgetting to pay attention to for a while. Keep that in the back of your mind and you'll be getting back into the whole story again in no time at all, and it will be almost impossible for you to ever forget it again.","I think that your outlook on atheism, nihilism and naturalism is unnecessarily bleak. They are actually pretty amazing to think about if you have the right mental state.

&gt; I learned about nihilism, atheism, existentialism, what happens after death, that we are just computers, emotions aren't real, just by-products of brain impulses

How does being a ""computer"" make emotions not real? When I have emotions, to me, it's a basic fact that I feel them. It doesn't matter how they come to be.

I would also like to single out your use of the word ""just"". Saying that emotions are ""just"" by-products of brain impulses suggests that you find this explanation underwhelming. I don't think that's right! Look at the mind-boggling variety of thoughts, emotions and personalities that can be obtained from varying brain impulses, and that's just a small sliver of all the possibilities. Try to imagine everything else that could be! I think there's something *grand* about naturalism, about everything it can do. To me, the thought that we are ""just"" chemicals is akin to the thought that we ""just"" have a billion dollars. It's already more than anybody should need.

&gt; I feel like now that I've gotten a peek at what we really are (sophisticated computers) that I can never be happy again.

Is that knowledge really that bad? Under naturalism, I know what I am: an amazingly sophisticated and very robust machine which is the culmination of billions of years of evolution. I have the possibility to study myself and gain better understanding of who I am and why I think the way I think. Under the ""soul"" model, I am just a mystery box. Perhaps that is what you prefer, but now that the illusion is shattered, you can try to see how beautiful of a machine you are.

&gt; I can't look at my kids and be happy anymore, knowing that anything we do is meaningless. Yes, I know there are the arguments that YOU have to provide meaning and make something out of the life you are given, but that doesn't help me feel better at all. It makes me feel worse. I feel like I have to work now to assign or find meaning, rather than it just naturally occurring and flowing and being part of my day-to-day life.

That sounds like depression. I'm a nihilist, but I've never had any trouble finding purpose and meaning in my life. It's not supposed to be *work*: there are things I like and that I want to do, people that I like and want to be happy, and so on, and to me they are goals worth pursuing in and of themselves.

Think of it this way: when you celebrate your child's birthday, you don't do it because it's ""meaningful"", you do it because you love them and want them to have a good time. You want to see the smile on their face. There isn't supposed to be a deep existential motivation for this. You don't play with your children *because* they will never die and you will live together forever in heaven, so why does it matter if that turns out to be false? That's the kind of distortion depression can create.

&gt; I tell myself that it is possible all humans, animals have souls. I know there is no scientific proof right now (except for the Lanza theories which I am not sold on), but I feel it's possible for everyone to just have that essential spark in them.

Well, perhaps they do, and that spark is physical. Instead of hoping for some supernatural soul, you could hope that some physical system can exist such that if it was well explained to you, you would feel that ""This is it! This is what I mean when I think about a soul!"" After all, you can't claim to be aware of all the nuances of naturalism and all the possibilities for what it can do, so you cannot be certain that it can never satisfactorily meet your criteria for soul or meaning. Think of that one time where you didn't understand something at all, but you read or were told an explanation that just illuminated everything. I would say I have had that illumination about naturalism -- naturalism is so awesome to me that I don't even *want* to have a soul. Machines are infinitely cooler than souls. So perhaps that can happen to you as well. Who knows!
",358,"I had an existential crisis of sorts a couple of years ago, so all of these thoughts are very familiar.

The idea of us all being essentially mechanical is a thought trap. It's logically appealing due to its backing in science and empiricism and all that... the problem with it is that it does a poor job of describing us humans.

Formally speaking, a piece of music is a combination of sine waves of varying amplitude and phases. A painting is a bunch of pigments that reflect different wavelengths of light. A book is a series of symbols, and not very inventive and diverse at that. A flower produces chemical substances that excite nerves in our olfactory system. Food combines nutrients with flavours and a bunch of other things.

None of these descriptions are wrong... and that's the insidious thing about them. Life isn't about being technically right. In fact, technically right is the dullest kind of right. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing at all wrong with seeing things as they truly are. In fact, being able to see things as they truly are is an extremely valuable skill. But the idea that reality is devoid of meaning and, to borrow a word from you, sparks... that's something you've added on top, for no good reason. That's the wrong part. That's the idea you have to doubt, to be sceptical about. People don't enjoy paintings and music and books and the experience of a sunset because of a bunch of mathematical equations. People enjoy these things because of what they mean. Do you know how insanely improbable it is for us to be able to look at a sunset, and breathe, and have trees framing the view, in the first place? The probability of that possibility having come to pass is so close to zero you can't even imagine a number that small. The world can be explained in terms of formulae and scientific models, but that never needs to take away the absolute miracle that it all is. And nobody really has an explanation of how the world could come to be the way it is now.

Some people turn to religion to explain the world and the things in it. Personally I have given up on trying to explain it. I think miracles don't *need* an explanation, even though of course explanations can be useful and enlightening.

In light of all that, the fact that we can ""explain"" our subjective experience in terms of an electrochemical apparatus that does things... that's just the tiniest detail. In fact we're really quite bad at explaining how our experience arises out of electrochemical processes. We kind of understand the interaction on the cellular level, and we've identified a bunch of areas in a bunch of tissue that seem to be doing something, stuff like that. The rest is still essentially intractable to us... but that doesn't stop people from going around proclaiming ""all you are is a bunch of chemicals"". Yeah, like that is a good explanation... that's just a fragment of an explanation, really.

Perhaps some day someone is going to discover, with tools that we haven't invented yet, that our electrochemical apparatus, if replicated atom by atom, doesn't work, that something is missing. And then that day we might realize that the world isn't as entirely physical as we thought. Or maybe we'll be able to make perfect copies of humans. In the present, however, we don't know. It's just thought experiments. We can argue about it until we're blue in the face but we still won't know. Here's a hint to keep in mind when reading research: ""we found no evidence"" doesn't mean the thing they looked for doesn't exist. It just means that the methodology used by the study was not suited for finding evidence *or* maybe the thing doesn't exist. We can't really tell the difference. (Taking this point further is a different topic, see /r/philosophyofscience.)

That medication can have side effects doesn't really answer the question one way or another. The environment we find ourselves in can influence our mood quite a bit, too. For instance, I don't like walking through heavy traffic nearly as much as through, say, a forest. So you might say my mood is caused by traffic -- it's not that different from saying my mood is caused by a bunch of chemical changes, a drug perhaps. Perhaps the traffic caused me to take drugs? At some point these attempts at causal explanations become ridiculously rickety. (And, by the way, it's perfectly possible to feel good despite traffic... I'd go as far as saying it's probably possible to feel good despite the drug, but of course I can't prove that and I certainly don't have a convenient step-by-step guide.)

There's a good chance that the stuff you've taken has influenced you... but, the way I see it, it doesn't directly ""cause"" your mood and thinking and all that, and certainly taking it away isn't going to directly ""cause"" you to go back to normal. Part of that is on you... you do that part by understanding that the way you were thinking about this that got you to write your post is not formally incorrect, but also just a tiny part of the real story that you've been forgetting to pay attention to for a while. Keep that in the back of your mind and you'll be getting back into the whole story again in no time at all, and it will be almost impossible for you to ever forget it again.","I think that your outlook on atheism, nihilism and naturalism is unnecessarily bleak. They are actually pretty amazing to think about if you have the right mental state.

&gt; I learned about nihilism, atheism, existentialism, what happens after death, that we are just computers, emotions aren't real, just by-products of brain impulses

How does being a ""computer"" make emotions not real? When I have emotions, to me, it's a basic fact that I feel them. It doesn't matter how they come to be.

I would also like to single out your use of the word ""just"". Saying that emotions are ""just"" by-products of brain impulses suggests that you find this explanation underwhelming. I don't think that's right! Look at the mind-boggling variety of thoughts, emotions and personalities that can be obtained from varying brain impulses, and that's just a small sliver of all the possibilities. Try to imagine everything else that could be! I think there's something *grand* about naturalism, about everything it can do. To me, the thought that we are ""just"" chemicals is akin to the thought that we ""just"" have a billion dollars. It's already more than anybody should need.

&gt; I feel like now that I've gotten a peek at what we really are (sophisticated computers) that I can never be happy again.

Is that knowledge really that bad? Under naturalism, I know what I am: an amazingly sophisticated and very robust machine which is the culmination of billions of years of evolution. I have the possibility to study myself and gain better understanding of who I am and why I think the way I think. Under the ""soul"" model, I am just a mystery box. Perhaps that is what you prefer, but now that the illusion is shattered, you can try to see how beautiful of a machine you are.

&gt; I can't look at my kids and be happy anymore, knowing that anything we do is meaningless. Yes, I know there are the arguments that YOU have to provide meaning and make something out of the life you are given, but that doesn't help me feel better at all. It makes me feel worse. I feel like I have to work now to assign or find meaning, rather than it just naturally occurring and flowing and being part of my day-to-day life.

"The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to tease out meaning. Many other amendments overlap in meaning and could be combined to simplify them while also covering more people. The fact is, it is outdated.

I believe it should be revised every 100 years or so because culture and language are organic. They change based on technology, public conscious, and international relations. Should we follow the advice of a group who believed slavery was acceptable? That thought only white, male, property owners should/could vote? Can you read through the document and understand what was meant or does much of it come across as confusing to todays readers? The world has changed and I believe we need to change with it in order to be relevant. I also believe our ideas and views from today will experience the same degradation over time. In 100 years will the world still care about gun rights? Will the population still speak mostly english or will we add more spanish to our vocabulary? Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had? We cannot know. We should not force our ideas through time, expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers.

What I can't understand is why we are clinging to the past, to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today. We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs. We should update, revise, and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are. I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either. I am saying we should interpret it for today, update it, and use our revised version instead. Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed. It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws. It would take a lot of work, a lot would change, but I believe we would be better for it. CMV

---Edit---
Many responses seem to think I am saying scrap the whole thing and start over. No, I am saying we need an updated, reworded one that uses the meanings as we take them today. All men are equal shoule read all persons, prohibition and its repeal should just be removed, the 15th and 19th should be combined and all inclusive with restrictions put in after the fact. Those are examples of what I mean but not the whole of it.

To CMV you need to show me that having an old, poorly worded document is better than a revision of it in modern terms. It would be hard to do but it would be better for the nation and easier to work with than if we left it be. CMV

"This is a view I've read about from various pop psychology sources, and it has become conventional wisdom. I believe it contains some truth. Can you convince me it merely reflects the fact that every person has pretty much every trait in them in some form, so if someone says ""I hate X"" they're bound to have some of X in their personality.

An important distinction: I'm talking about ""hate"" that people regularly bring up, like a person who's known for having a hate or dislike of something in particular (something non-trivial, not broccoli or crap movies): **Things that people hate which they think about regularly.**

When people say they hate homosexuals, odds are pretty high they have closeted homosexual desires. This has become a running joke among gay acceptance (i.e. decent) people.

When people say they hate intolerance, you'll often find they're very intolerant of views that strike them as incorrect or un-PC.

Now, take something horrendously evil like pederasty/paedophilia. One of the most heinous, evil, horrible acts possible. Most people I know, however, when asked what they hate in people, don't really mention acts like that. They mention less horrifically evil things: I hate bullies, I hate hypocrisy, I hate rudeness. 

We may want to kill a convicted paedophile with our bare hands, but during our day to day lives we don't think about them often or say we ""hate"" them--we save our long-term hatreds for less evil things. (This may simply be because (say) pedos are so rare and don't show up in our lives very often, or, because people don't hate that which isn't in their own psychological repertoire, or a mixture of both.)

When I say ""I hate religious extremists"", I don't have to be religious to say it, but the underlying trait I hate may be closed-mindedness, which I may hate in myself and which I am afraid of exhibiting. I am 100% convinced I do not have a closed mind, but I cannot easily prove it. Do diehard atheists disprove the idea that what we hate most we hate in ourselves? I also hate animal cruelty, and I've never hurt an animal (knowingly) in my life and have absolutely zero secret or repressed desire to do so. But then again I don't really think about animal cruelty very often, but I do think about other things I hate: petty-mindedness, mean-spiritedness, etc.

Is it all just pop psych bs? I would like a good argument against the idea that our common/over-time objects of hate--particularly a character trait in other people--does not necessarily reflect a hatred of those traits in yourself and a fear that you will express them.

"Hey CMV, I'll keep this one simple. I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or other easily lethal weapon, they have no place in society and have a fundamental defect in their human brain chemistry (without even touching on the trauma and psychological damage the victims must suffer).
To me, this type of crime shows an extreme amount of depravity. You're brandishing a weapon, ready to kill a person you do not even know, for short term profit. This especially applies to home invasions and store robberies.
The reason I added the 'positively identified' caveat is that I don't want to leave any room for putting an innocent person to death, so for this case to kick in, I would need either CCTV confirming their identity, or multiple eye witnesses confirming their identity. 
I'm willing to admit this view may be on the extreme side, but I like to think I'm a reasonable person and I'm open to change. So reddit, please CMV.

**EDIT: I should have clarified, please assume LOADED weapons or a knife, and the offender is NOT a juvenile. To me, these are different cases and do not deserve the death penalty.**

The death penalty for armed robberies would be insanely, unrealistically expensive.  Death penalty cases cost way more than even life in prison, because we want to be really really sure we're right before we execute someone.

Last year, according to the FBI, there were about 345,454 armed robberies in the US.  The actual costs of a death penalty case vary, but somewhere around $1,000,000 seems like a pretty common estimate.  So, in a year, we're looking at about $345,454,000,000.  Is that really worth it?  Are the benefits (reduced crime rate, comfort to the victims...) really worth the 300 BILLION dollar price tag?  Who's paying for that?  Is that really the best use of the money?

Morality aside (and for the record, I'm very morally against it), death penalty for armed robbery would just be too expensive.

http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty","1. There's not a correlation between crime rates dropping in areas where the severity of punishment is harsher. For example, in Texas, the death penalty is present, but it doesn't stop people from murdering other people. Another example: in the top 20 states with murders per 100,000 people, or rather, in the top 20 worst states for murder rates, only 5 do not have the death penalty. In the top 20 states with the LOWEST murder rates, 12/20 do NOT have the death penalty. It can be argued that punishment is not a detractor of criminal behavior.

2. As a personal anecdote, my apartment was broken into when I was just a year out of college. My girlfriend at the time came home to find the house had been broken into and apparently the people had just left. She went upstairs and found a knife from our kitchen, upstairs in our bedroom. So the robber had broken in, taken the knife from our kitchen and brought it upstairs with him in case he met anyone up there, I guess. But who is to say his intent? Was it scary as shit? YES. Did it make me feel very unsafe in my home? YES. But I also know that some robbers carry weapons solely for personal protection and not to actively harm people.

There's not a correlation between crime rates dropping in areas where the severity of punishment is harsher. For example, in Texas, the death penalty is present, but it doesn't stop people from murdering other people. Another example: in the top 20 states with murders per 100,000 people, or rather, in the top 20 worst states for murder rates, only 5 do not have the death penalty. In the top 20 states with the LOWEST murder rates, 12/20 do NOT have the death penalty. It can be argued that punishment is not a detractor of criminal behavior.

2. As a personal anecdote, my apartment was broken into when I was just a year out of college. My girlfriend at the time came home to find the house had been broken into and apparently the people had just left. She went upstairs and found a knife from our kitchen, upstairs in our bedroom. So the robber had broken in, taken the knife from our kitchen and brought it upstairs with him in case he met anyone up there, I guess. But who is to say his intent? Was it scary as shit? YES. Did it make me feel very unsafe in my home? YES. But I also know that some robbers carry weapons solely for personal protection and not to actively harm people. Some robbers take them and use them to scare or intimidate people. Who is to say that it was ever their intention to use it on someone? Seems a pretty stiff penalty to give someone the death penalty when you could never truly know their intentions or if they would have gone through with it.

Hopefully most have been caught and ~~killed~~ I mean, uh... fixed.","It doesn't seem like the moral arguments are changing your mind, so I'll try taking a different approach. The death penalty for armed robberies would be insanely, unrealistically expensive.  Death penalty cases cost way more than even life in prison, because we want to be really really sure we're right before we execute someone.

Last year, according to the FBI, there were about 345,454 armed robberies in the US.  The actual costs of a death penalty case vary, but somewhere around $1,000,000 seems like a pretty common estimate.  So, in a year, we're looking at about $345,454,000,000.  Is that really worth it?  Are the benefits (reduced crime rate, comfort to the victims...) really worth the 300 BILLION dollar price tag?  Who's paying for that?  Is that really the best use of the money?

Morality aside (and for the record, I'm very morally against it), death penalty for armed robbery would just be too expensive.

"I realize the OP is a bit vague, so let me clarify.  Similar to false advertising, I believe that people who release lies (in a publishable, marketable format).  This includes magazines, (information based) books,  etc.

 Now, dont get me wrong.  I fully agree with freedom of speech. But when the speech is being purposely distributed to the public to spread lies, my agreement tends to disappear.  

I'll just clarify a little bit more.  if a book is saying something, claiming facts that are not true, (for the sake of argument) that the US faked the moonlanding but there is massive evidence against it,  this book should not be allowed.  same with ""documentary"" books that base arguments against fake studies etc.

"Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and I encourage all men who have been sexually abused to immediately seek help, but I have trouble feeling as bad for men who are raped and it's hard for me to weigh the impact of that rape on their lives. 

The reason is because whenever I think of women getting raped, I think of a strong (and sometimes old) man who clearly has power of a much weaker woman forcing her to do things that she finds derogatory. The fact that women are the prominent gender in the sex slave trade doesn't help. That only makes me feel like a man raping a woman is essentially treating her like property and belittling her humanity. Also, although I can't prove this scientifically, we all know at least that society views men as horny fucks who are out there just to fuck women. This evokes some feeling in me that women are men's ""prey"" and they are the victims who have to put up with this feeling of worthlessness. 

Whenever I think of a man getting raped however, I think of a guy who has had a little too much to drink and is being coerced into sex by a woman who finds him attractive. Yeah, he may not want to have sex with her, and yeah at that point he is way too weak to resist, but because he's a man, there's something inside of me that feels like he can deal with this and it's simply just another night that didn't go so well. Now as for gay men, that's different and I can sympathize with them more, especially if they were the ones who were penetrated. Even though I feel that way with gays, I still don't think of rape of gay men as bad as rape of women.

I guess I may see being penetrated unwillingly as worse than having to penetrate someone against your will. But the fact that toughness and security are associated with males and feebleness and innocence are associated with women also doesn't help. 

I really do hate my stance on this because I like to think of myself as a benevolent person who wants the common good for everyone. Please tell my why I should *think* of male rape as bad as female rape. Again, I really want my view to change.

"I just read this [article](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-adv-asian-race-tutoring-20150222-story.html#page=1) stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering that only certain minorities have an easier time getting in, while others like asians have a much harder time. It should be based on your grade average and the score you get on your SAT (I'm from Canada so I'm not really sure how SAT score factors into that. I'm used to only your high school grades being counted). If an asian student gets a 90% average, his/her application shouldn't be tossed aside for a black student who only managed to get an 83% average. Maybe in the past affirmative action was necessary, due to racial bias. Nowadays it's completely useless and does nothing but inhibit asians and whites.

I believe your race shouldn't matter when it comes to these things. It's like saying blacks and hispanics are more stupid than asians and whites and therefore should get some help to get into college. Also, before you say that it has to do with economic status, I would like to disagree. My family (including cousins and whatnot) came from very poor circumstances. However, most of my cousins have gone on to get degrees in things like engineering. If you don't do good in school, it's either because your capacity to learn in that certain subject or in general is lower than other people (say being bad at math or English) or you just didn't try hard enough.

And we have a very different racial make-up as a result of us not really having had the same numbers of slaves or the same violent opposition towards civil rights. We also don't see quite the same level of disparity between racial groups socio-economically. Our disadvantaged minorities are less disadvantaged than those of the US. 

So our universities don't really implement racial quotas quite the same way as the United States does. 

In Canada the closest thing we have to affirmative choice is universities' treatment of aboriginal students - sometimes qualifying under separate categories and getting additional funding support.

And that's contentious too, but it's not made to punish other people, it's really meant as an effort to help counteract the additional challenges faced by Aboriginal students in obtaining an education. One of the best ways to help aboriginal populations in general is to remove as many barriers to education as possible - people who are empowered and well-employed are great for their community. They're leaders and examples for youth, they're often able funnel money back into their communities for development, they're often better able to service their communities. Setting aside spots for them isn't meant to remove spots for white kids. It's not. Aboriginal students who make it to university often had to attend rougher schools on or near reserves. They're more likely to grow up in foster care. They're less likely to have university-educated parents.

Just imagine that you're a highschool student living with your paternal grandmother - a woman who attended residential school. She didn't receive a great education - she probably left the moment she was able to because residential school was a shitty time for a lot of students and they got schooling that was far below the standards set for other students. When you're raised in an environment where school is a scary, violent, abusive force it doesn't necessarily breed the same academic support.

There are all these barriers that stack up together to make it really hard for them to get into the same programs.

Aboriginal special acceptance programs aren't meant to punish poor or disadvantaged non-aboriginal kids. They're simply meant to help provide clearer avenues for aboriginal students to access education.

I think that's what affirmative action looks to do in the US. 

Affirmative action isn't perfect. You get advantaged kids in any race. But it's one of the best tools we do have for helping poor and depressed groups help themselves. Admitting their kids to universities helps them lift their communities up and that's worth the imperfections in the system. ","I think there is a lot that can be said about subtle ways in which Black and Hispanic students are at a disadvantage in the admissions process, and I agree with other commenters who are making this point, but I actually want to come at this issue from a slightly different direction.   Consider the admissions process not from the perspective of the student, but from the perspective of the college.  The college's job is not to find and admit the ""best"" or ""smartest"" students, whatever that might mean, but rather to admit the students who are going to benefit the college the most.  Most admissions officers, especially at elite private schools in the U.S., will readily admit this if asked.  You can argue that this is somehow ""unfair,"" but remember that the first and most important job of a college is to maximize its own ability to do high-quality education and research.


Admitting a racially diverse student body helps the college achieve this aim in a variety of ways:

1. It helps attract a larger applicant pool.  Some students applying to college value ""diversity"" and will choose to apply to colleges with visible racial minorities preferentially over colleges that are dominated by White students.  Conversely, very few students will cross a college off their list because it is ""too diverse.""  So the college has nothing to lose and everything to gain in terms of attracting more applicants if there's more visible diversity.  Colleges would always rather have more applicants than they can admit because then they appear more selective, and thus more prestigious.

2. It keeps alumni and donors happy (who value the perception that the college is ""diverse""), who will then give the college more money which it can spend on things like increasing the quality of its programs or providing more financial aid to needy students.

3. It increases the number of student perspectives on campus, broadening the range of discourse in and out of classes and leading to a higher-quality education as students are exposed to a broader set of ideas and experiences.

4. It gives the college a broader alumni base in communities other than those dominated by Whites and/or Asians.  This helps increase the college's general name recognition and prestige.

"I've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the support for the lady. 

The jury found McDonald's to be 80% responsible and awarded several million dollars compensation, which was later reduced to about 600 000 dollars, and then later settled.

Acording to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants) and another [website](http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm) here are the abridged facts of the incident as I understand them.

* coffee was ordered at a drive through window
* coffee was handed to Liebeck
* Liebeck's son drove off
* they stopped so Liebeck could add sugar
* Liebeck spilled the entire cup over her lap, hence severely injuring her

My argument that it is not McDonald's responsibility is that she had been safely handed the coffee. The transaction was complete and she had control. If the coffee had been spilled during the handover I would view it the other way around.

There are two arguments that I reject. I reject that the severity of the injury affects the responsibility. Comments such as ""have you seen those injuries, they're horrific, she had to be reconstructed"" are common. This is true, they were appalling injuries. But I think this is a strawman argument because my point is that it was not McDonald's responsibility after the handover, not that the injuries were minor. 

I reject that the coffee was too hot. These are hot drinks. It's obvious to me, and I would hope anyone who intends to drink such a drink that it would be hot and care should be given. Perhaps my culture views it differently. I grew up in England, and here 9 and ten year olds make tea for themselves; kettles boil water and then that water is poured into a teapot / cup. We know from a young age that this is dangerous and extreme care must be taken when handling such hot water. Indeed, in a similar UK case against McDonald's regarding hot coffee, the judge ruled that McDonald's was not responsible, one of the reasons being that people expect hot drinks to be hot and should make reasonable safety measures themselves. I do not believe Americans don't realise hot water is dangerous.

 If anyone would like to comment, I'd be happy to elaborate further. I look forward to having interesting discussion.

**EDIT:** *Thank you for your replies so far, I'm working my way through replying to them.*

**EDIT:** *Thank you for your comments and discussion. I have awarded deltas to comments that highlighted arguments that I had not considered. My view is still that McDonald's were not liable for any costs. I have come to the conclusion that the discrepancy is due to a difference in cultural expectations of temperature of served hot drinks. I was brought up in a culture where water is regularly boiled at home and hence all children learn how to be careful around just-boiled water. As mentioned above, that is part of the reason why an almost identical case was thrown out in the UK.*

The jury never found that McDonald's was entirely responsible.   
The award was given to the plaintiff based on the principle of 'Comparative Negligence'. This principle isn't applied in all jurisdictions, but it *is* used in the jurisdiction wherein the incident and the lawsuit took place.   
According to this doctrine the plaintiff can be awarded damages even if they themselves contributed to the damage.    
    
So taking all of the evidence that McDonald's was *to some extent* responsible, they were also to some extent liable.    
   
Given the over-heated coffee they carried some liability; but I think more importantly they intentionally down-played the warning on the coffee cup. That was probably done to make the cup more aesthetically pleasing, but it nonetheless seats them with some responsibility.   
They took their own warning to their customers and made it negligible so that the cup would be attractive.    
   
I don't think it can be argued that McDonald's carried zero responsibility for the incident and the law in that state makes it clear that they are therefore liable *to some extent*.  ","As I see it, you're arguing from the wrong stand point. 

Your view is mostly based around the notion that customers should expect a hot drink to be hot, and therefore handle it carefully. This is logical and thus at a first glance seems like an argument in the context of this lawsuit.

However, it is irrelevant because it is not mutually exclusive with the notion of serving (easily tippable, might I add) hot drinks that will not cause severe (3rd degree) burns in the event of the cup tipping over. Something we can very easily observe when you look at just about any other establishment that sells coffee.

The loose thread in your reasoning is as follows: should customers handle hot drinks carefully? Yes. However, should establishments sell hot drinks in handheld, plastic cups that will cause you 3rd degree burns if spilled? No. And the thing is that there is a very extensive middle ground in here, to which all establishments selling this sort of items adhere to.

For this reason, McDonald's was found liable.",365,"As I see it, you're arguing from the wrong stand point. 

Your view is mostly based around the notion that customers should expect a hot drink to be hot, and therefore handle it carefully. This is logical and thus at a first glance seems like an argument in the context of this lawsuit.

However, it is irrelevant because it is not mutually exclusive with the notion of serving (easily tippable, might I add) hot drinks that will not cause severe (3rd degree) burns in the event of the cup tipping over. Something we can very easily observe when you look at just about any other establishment that sells coffee.

The loose thread in your reasoning is as follows: should customers handle hot drinks carefully? Yes. However, should establishments sell hot drinks in handheld, plastic cups that will cause you 3rd degree burns if spilled? No. And the thing is that there is a very extensive middle ground in here, to which all establishments selling this sort of items adhere to.

For this reason, McDonald's was found liable.","I think the important thing here is *why* she won the suit.    
   
The jury never found that McDonald's was entirely responsible.   
The award was given to the plaintiff based on the principle of 'Comparative Negligence'. This principle isn't applied in all jurisdictions, but it *is* used in the jurisdiction wherein the incident and the lawsuit took place.   
According to this doctrine the plaintiff can be awarded damages even if they themselves contributed to the damage.    
    
So taking all of the evidence that McDonald's was *to some extent* responsible, they were also to some extent liable.    
   
Given the over-heated coffee they carried some liability; but I think more importantly they intentionally down-played the warning on the coffee cup. That was probably done to make the cup more aesthetically pleasing, but it nonetheless seats them with some responsibility.   
They took their own warning to their customers and made it negligible so that the cup would be attractive.    
   
I don't think it can be argued that McDonald's carried zero responsibility for the incident and the law in that state makes it clear that they are therefore liable *to some extent*.  ",r2,0.7,0.3,0.8,0.6,0.4,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.3,0.8,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.9,0.0,0.5,r2,,
"I know according to /r/futurology self-driving cars are the next big thing, but I don't think we've extrapolated this one properly.  I see car technology slowly chugging along, more of what we are seeing today, help reversing, parallel parking etc.  I see this trend continuing and improving, I don't think the next generation of cars will suddenly allow us to go 65 mph on the highway while we’re sipping margaritas in the back seat.  I don't think that's the goal.  

Google had a project where they created a self driving car, they were pretty successful.  I think it's great new technology, but I don't see it transferring it over to average consumers.

If you disagree with me up until this point, here's my biggest concession.  The trend of car ownership will decrease at a faster rate than self-driving cars will increase.  Meaning, by the time we have self-driving cars everywhere, no one will own a car, it will be a completely different paradigm.

"Sorry, this is mostly applicable to folks from the US, but feel free to weigh in no matter what.  I'll bullet-point for my reasoning:

* More good folks are killed via firearms than are saved by them.  The vast majority of firearm deaths are via suicide, which has an incredibly high success rate compared to all other methods.  Therefore since firearms cause more deaths than they prevent, firearms pose a net-loss for society.

* One major reason we believe we need firearms is the 2nd amendment.  The 2nd amendment is essentially an axiom; in order to have a moral argument as to why we should have guns, I don't think ""because the 2nd amendment says so"" is compelling.  If the 2nd amendment told us to punch babies, that wouldn't make it okay.  Therefore whether or not firearms are truly acceptable must be for a reason outside of this.

* Our logical balance doesn't make sense.  To paraphrase John Oliver, one guy tried to blow up a plane with a shoe and now we all take our shoes off at security.  But so many people shoot up so many schools, and we still haven't done anything substantial about it.  On a similar note, we invest how many trillions of dollars on the war on terror, and yet the amount of Americans killed via guns exceeds the amount killed via terrorism by an extraordinary amount.

* I've read Scalia's opinion in D.C. v. Heller (The most important guns case in modern times).  I don't find the appeal to history compelling.  It seems to me that times have changed so much that arguing what Thomas Jefferson was thinking and then applying it to semi-automatic and automatic weapons just doesn't make sense.  For someone who claims to be a textualist, this appears to me to be a stretch.

* The 2nd amendment and it's current interpretation quashes any possibility of experimentation.  I think part of the American experiment is to allow different states to try different things.  One of the arguments for gun rights is ""what worked for Australia couldn't work for us"".  And yet one only needs to look at Chicago (the city banned some firearms, SCOTUS said that was unacceptable and ruled against Chicago's law) to see that we were never given a chance to figure out what worked.  I would normally suggest an amendment if we wanted to clarify the 2nd amendment for modern times, but it seems to me that nobody will ever be convinced guns are bad (or good!) until we have a concrete application and see whether it works or not.

"**GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE.**

Reasons being:

1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a job or any personal income to speak of. I don't have the financial independence to live by this creed.

2. It sounds like not much fun

One of those reasons is pretty valid and one definitely isn't.

I believe this because it just makes the most logical sense to me. Why on earth would it be fair for me to walk around with a new pair of shoes when there's people I can see *in my own damn neighborhood* who can't afford a square meal, to speak nothing of comfortable clothing? It's just...wrong.

That's why I think that as soon as somebody has their basic needs and some *reasonable, modest* comforts like a TV, and air conditioning, any more money past that should go to a charity, or similarly be used for good.

**I'm really, really not trying to be high and mighty about this**. I don't live like this, and honestly even when I move out and start making my own money I don't think I'd be able to bring myself to throw out the PC and the cellphone and the car. I also don't think there's any non-arbitrary specific point where it could be declared that someone is being selfish with their money, and also everybody's definition of ""basic needs and modest comforts"" is probably different. I think you still get my meaning.

I still believe, speaking in idealistic terms, it's unjustifiable to keep to yourself what would be best spent saving others.

**EDIT:** My V has been C'd! /u/Lesser_Frigate_Bird made a good comment please read it. Keep the responses coming if you want though!

**EDIT2:** A couple of challenges have been along the lines of, ""where do you draw the line on what's a basic need and what's frivolous spending?"" to which I'd have to respond, ""I don't know but I think you catch my drift"". Obviously if we were going to codify this belief into law there would need to be a strict number or strict criteria but on an individual basis, even though it'd be different from person to person, I think everybody knows roughly what's a reasonable need or desire and what's too much.

"There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud ""woo-ing"" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. *Edit: He may have another disability as well, it was difficult to tell. Deafness was the only apparent one.* Much of the audience was clearly uncomfortable, but didn't want to ask his guardians or someone from the theater to get him to leave. I was having quite the moral dilemma about it, I didn't ask either, so I'm not saying that anyone was in the wrong about staying quiet.

Perhaps he shouldn't have been at the movie to begin with because of the graphic nature of the film, but that wouldn't have been enough to ask him to leave. 

So, change my view. Even though this child had a clear disability and the disability is why he was being a disturbance, it should be okay for him to be kicked out without repercussion.

Edited for grammar.
Edited for clarity. 

##Edit: Also I'm an idiot, it was Jurassic World, not Jurassic Park.

Things I do still believe: his guardians/parents should have quieted him or had him leave, ~~but he shouldn't have been kicked out of the movie.~~ If I had spoken to an usher, then the usher could have asked ~~him~~ *edit: his guardians* to be quiet, ~~but that's all I could have expected.~~ *Edit: maybe it would be okay for him to be removed still, struggling with this one.* *Edit: I shouldn't approach the guardians.* Otherwise I would expect to get a refund and go see the movie another time.

~~What a weird conclusion.~~

Without all of the strikethroughs/edits: ""his guardians/parents should have quieted him or had him leave. If I had spoken to an usher, then the usher could have asked his guardians to be quiet. Maybe it would be okay for him to be removed still, I'm struggling with this part still. I shouldn't approach the guardians. Otherwise I would expect to get a refund and go see the movie another time.

#Current struggle points:

* Is his time &amp; enjoyment more valuable than the rest of the moviegoer's combined?
* What are arguments against him going to a time dedicated to children/families, a time with significantly less viewers, or some other method of viewing that wouldn't have caused a disturbance to others? 

#Irrelevant at this point:

* I know I can ask the manager for a refund and/or leave. That doesn't address my view, or change it.

#Update:

At this point, I will only respond to those I feel like are making a good case or I want more information from. I highly encourage continued posting, I am reading absolutely everything and genuinely interested in what people are saying.

"If every nation had a large nuclear arsenal, and was willing to use it if they were invaded, than no one would ever invade anyone else because of mutually assured destruction! In the Cold War the USA and USSR both hated each other, but they knew if they went to war nukes would start flying and both sides would be destroyed.  The same happened with Pakistan and India, they both hated each other, and fought several wars, but once they both got nukes, they stopped fighting because they knew it wasn’t worth the cost of being nuked.

When a nation has nuclear capabilities, no one invades them. If everyone had nuclear capabilities, than no one would ever invade anyone else because of mutually assured destruction.

Edit: I never said we should start giving away free nukes to all who want them. We especially don't want our enemies to have nukes, do we?

"Having one Bernie Sanders as President is one thing but I don't think it'll result in anything even close to what his supporters would hope. 

Let's cut the cynicism for a moment and let's say that Bernie Sanders is one hundred percent dedicated and accomplishing each and every one of his goals laid out in his agenda. 

Given that the right hates this guy and the amount of corporate influence amongst the Senate (and it's not just limited to the right, I realize), I don't think it's worth being invested in who becomes President so long as the GOP remains as influential as they are in Congress. 

We don't need one Bernie. We need 100 Bernies.

&gt;We need 100 Bernies.

60 Bernies would be sufficient to be filibuster-proof.

Now, for serious discussion.  Saying he ""cant follow up on any"" is a bit of an overstatement.  Can he do everything he'd like to do the way he'd like to?  No.  But can he make moves in the right direction?  Sure.

Let's look at his Agenda:

*  1. Rebuilding Our Crumbling Infrastructure

Now, this is something that he'd absolutely need Congressional help with.  But it's not hard to sell as pro-business and pro-jobs.  Americans like highways.

* 2. Reversing Climate Change

There is a lot he can do with EPA regulations.  And, again, he sells it as ""Transforming our energy system will not only protect the environment, it will create good paying jobs.""

* 3. Creating Worker Co-ops

Frankly, I'm not sure what, legally would be required for this - whether the department of labor alone can get this done, or he'd need help from Congress.

* 4. Growing the Trade Union Movement

Again, this is somewhat of a mixed bag, but probably more Congress than DoL.  It's also something that I think has some limitations at the Federal level, since a lot of it is governed at the state.

* 5. Raising the Minimum Wage

Definitely needs Congress.

* 6. Pay Equity for Women Workers

I believe that there are already laws on the books that he could choose to enforce more vigorously.  But I'm also not sure what he thinks the goverment should do about this.

* 7. Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers

Now, this is something that the president can absolutely have a huge impact on.

* 8. Making College Affordable for All

Obama has made some strides here.  I don't know how much more he can do without Congress.

* 9. Taking on Wall Street

Again, there's a lot more stringent enforcement of laws, investigations into trading, etc that the executive branch can do, but they certainly can't ""break up the banks"" without Congress.

* 10. Health Care as a Right for All

Yeah, single-payer for everyone can't happen without Congress.

* 11. Protecting the Most Vulnerable Americans

Another one where he can't expand social programs without Congress.

* 12. Real Tax Reform
Again, Congress needs to amend tax law.  Even enforcing through the IRS is restricted by Congressional law.

So, after all of this, I think you're view that ""He can't follow up on any of his points"" is an overstatement, but, yeah, what he can do will be limited with a hostile Congress.","Sanders is perfectly capable of shutting down free trade and messing with the Federal Reserve without Congressional support.

Of course, I would argue that makes him WORSE: because the stuff he's arguing for that his supporters are actually championing for and which may be good won't get passed, but the stuff where he is absolutely nuts will. In short, with a Sanders president, you'll just be getting the terrible things he advocates with him.

So, a CMV response....in a manner of speaking.

"The implementation of **Judicial Review** from the *Marbury v. Madison* case from the precedent of the **Judiciary Act of 1789** allows for the Supreme court to be to judge over the legislative branch and executive branch of government. 

Furthermore, *Fletcher v. Peck* allows for the overturing of state laws in the Supreme Court, which changed the balance of state versus federal government power in favor of the federal government.

In *McCulloch v. Maryland*, the supreme Court cited the **""necessary and proper""** or **elastic clause** in the constitution to implement laws not explicitly stated in the text. (In this case being the Second Bank of the United States and the legality of a state entity taxing the federal bank.)

*Cohens v. Virginia* allowes for the Supreme Court to superceede state bank's ruling on criminal charges.

Finally, although some may argue that the court is checked by the circumstances by which Justices reach the position- recommendation by the president and approval by the senate, but once inside the court, they have life tenure. [Even the impeachment of Justices accused of public drunkeness and insanity have not been sucessfully carried out.](http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Tries_Justice.htm)

#Ultimately, this means that: 

1. The Supreme Court can judge legality of the actions of the Legislative and Executive brantches of government.

2. The Supreme Court rules over the state courts.

3. The Supreme Court can create laws that are ""Necessary and Proper""

4. Criminals otherwise convicted by state courts can be retrialed with the Supreme Court.

5. Life tenure is nearly garenteed as no justice have been impeached in US History.","The natural objection to your view is that the court can only rule on cases that are brought to them as it severely limits the absolute power they wield in terms of making final decisions on all manner of legal questions.  Points 1, 2, and 4 of yours however, certainly show that the court has quite a lot of formidable power to wield, but considering all of those powers can only be used in reaction to other entities exercizing their own powers first, then being sued for it, followed by multiple appeals, it is hard to view what essentially is a veto power as equal to those they are ruling over.   Add to that the fact that even that veto power is constrained by the majority of justices having to agree how to rule and it's even harder to consider the power they wield to be unrivaled in the country. 

For number 5, you never compared the likelihood of removal from the Supreme Court to the other branches.   In neither of the other branches is it easy or common for an official to be forcibly removed from office as a president has never been removed either and only 20 of over 12,000 congressmen have ever been removed.   Of course they still don't have to face public reelection but since their job does not involve representing the people's will or interests as they see fit anyway, it really makes no difference.  Their job is to apply the laws which have already been written (supposedly) to thay effect. 

The meat of your case seems to be 3 though, in that they can effectively can create laws.  Characterizing the case you sited in support of that notion as the Court creating a law looks to me like an enormous stretch though.  Based on what I read, it seems perhaps more accurate to say that they established Congress' right to act with new powers that were not specifically granted them by the Constitution, but were instead implied.  Taking your characterization 
 for granted though, they still can ""create new laws"" that Congress has sought to use and someone else has fought to prevent them from using.  

**TL;DR** 
All of the unique advantages the Supreme Court has that you list are fundamentally restricted in scope compared to the advantages the other branches have.  The most basic and important power common to both of the other branches is simply the ability to use their powers when they choose to.  That basic ability affords them far more flexibility than the Supreme Court to effect political change.   If Congress collectively wanted to make a law to ban all gun ownership in the US, they could, and the Supreme Court could not do a thing about it unless someone else objected first.  ","Wow, where to begin? :/

&gt;The Supreme Court can judge legality of the actions of the Legislative and Executive brantches of government.

Sort of accurate...*sort* of; the Court can judge the *constitutionality* of Congress' and the President's actions. this doesn't mean the Court can just go around issuing opinions on a whim; there has to be an actual case that raises a justiciable question. The case has to work its way up from the lower courts, then SCOTUS has to grant certiorari (which is rare). 

&gt;The Supreme Court rules over the state courts.

Not entirely accurate. Supreme court precedent *is*, indeed, binding on lower and state courts. But again, that precedent has to come from a CASE. SCOTUS can't just call up the Supreme Ct. of Florida one day and be like ""yo, y'all have to treat gay marriages the same as all other marriages because Amendment 14."" Lower courts are also free to distinguish fact patterns that set their cases apart from SCOTUS' precedent. SCOTUS makes binding opinions, it doesn't ""rule over"" anyone. 

&gt;The Supreme Court can create laws that are ""Necessary and Proper""

The Supreme Court doesn't ""make laws."" That's just Government 101. And the Nec. and Proper clause is in Art. I of the Constitution; it's one of *congress'* powers not the Court's. And your reading of *McCulloch* is 100% wrong. That decision established that the N&amp;P clause gives Congress (CONGRESS!) implied powers, that aren't written down specifically in the Constitution. Honestly, this point you've made is wrong on absolutely every level. Not to sound mean, but it is. 

&gt;Criminals otherwise convicted by state courts can be retrialed (sic) with the Supreme Court.

No. The Supreme Court is mainly an appellate court. It *does* have original jurisdiction (Art. III, Section 2 of the Constitution), but not over criminal cases. SCOTUS *can* overturn convictions if they are unconstitutional in some way, but they can't just call up a trial court and say ""fuck your decision, we're 'retrial'-ing that guy."" No. 

&gt;Life tenure is nearly garenteed (sic) as no justice have been impeached in US History.

Wrong. Look up Samuel Chase. Justices *do* serve for live as long as they don't fuck up majorly. Whether or not that's a good thing is another debate entirely, which has raged across history in its own way. 

The amount of power the Court has in relation to the other branches, in the subjective sense of the word, I suppose is still up for debate. The Federal Government is specifically set up in such a way, however, as to use each branch to limit the others. Congress can ultimately overturn a SCOTUS decision with a constitutional amendment, or can circumvent it by re-drafting the legislation in question. 
Either way, your argument is based on a series of pretty big misunderstandings of how SCOTUS and Constitutional Law work. Again, I'm not trying to sound like an elitist asshole, this stuff is just largely, glaringly wrong.

"I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a 'joke' as angry liberals make it seem.

What I'm trying to say, is that people should not be forced into believing and supporting gay marriage, gay/lesbian/transgender/pansexual and all that—they should be allowed to express their freedom of religion without the oppression of liberalism the way they expect not to be oppressed by conservatism. Seems very hypocritical, no?

The point here, is that staunch liberals have a very high tendency to be hypocritical towards religion, but get really offended when a conservative does the same towards them.

It all makes no sense to me, and I want to be open to changing my belief about this one way or the other. It's a big mess that aggravates me, because no one on the far sides of the spectrum sticks to their word very well. I'm a libertarian, so I have my likes and dislikes toward each side, and I would like to understand these specific viewpoints better.

EDIT: This blew up a lot more than I thought it would, which is good. I got a lot of clarification, and I've awarded some &amp;#8710;'s. To be more specific (if you're trying to step in my shoes), I USED to be a devout Catholic, until I thought some of the teachings were immoral and 'behind the times.' I just don't think that religion is a bunch of crap as some make it out to seem; however, since my view has been changed, I believe that as people should have freedom of religion, that freedom of religion can only go so far before it becomes a legal issue. I believe that freedom of religion already has a more bigoted starting point than the opposite viewpoint which is more 'realistic' shall I say.","I assume the following points are correct:

you are not religious 

OR you do not favor your religious freedom above others.

Here is my argument:
It is a debate between understanding of freedom. Does religious freedom stand above any other freedom? Very few people would say that.

"I have played Hearthstone since its beta and have had great times with it (I still do).

My massive issue with the game is that the current meta relies too heavily on strung together mech cards that perfectly mesh with each other and do no evoke a skill-based theme or tactic. The expansion has encouraged players to make decks that kill quickly before the game can even begin to get interesting; this avoids the entirety of what makes Hearthstone special.

Another thing is that Legendaries are totally whack as a core concept. They come off as useful tools to take out foes but are secretly a ploy to get ""consumers"" to buy packs to try and earn them (in a free-to-play game). The rarity of these cards even further prove that it benefits those who purchase packs in bulk and get them quicker, letting them get ""better"" faster and leave other players in the dust.

Blizzard has also recently lowered the chance of getting decent dailies, meaning you have a lower chance of generating in game currency, further benefiting the payers.

Cards involving random chance while also altering the mana curve (Voidcaller, Unstoppable Portal, Alarm-o-Bot) are devastating and should not exist. This is different than Druid's mana increasing cards as this is a calculated strategy that is understood by the opponent.

"Why I hold this view:

1.  America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.

2. Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda executed a brutal plan to orchestrate the 9/11 attacks. [According to them, their major motivation was to end the presence of US in gulf countries and other motives as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks#Motives) For this purpose they chose to ram airplanes in the WTC  &amp; Pentagon to achieve maximum civilian casualties and make a frightening spectacle for the US public. The ends justify the means seems to be their reasoning. Was Al-Qaeda &amp; Co justified in perpetrating 9/11? 
No one would say yes.

     If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths. 


3. Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.

4. The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared. How do we even know the outcome of Operation Downfall? Moreover Japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the Secretary Of War, Henry Louis Stimson agreed: 

“Japan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.”


We erased two cities and its people from history. We dehumanized them, reduced them to a statistic. W[e even censored images and stories of the Japanese victims to push the narrative in our direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Depiction.2C_public_response_and_censorship). At least the Government should officially apologize to the nation of Japan.
","Hiroshima and Nagasaki were entirely justified by the standards of the time. You're objection is also rather interesting, because you seem to be hung up on the use of nuclear weapons, when that's not even the worst thing that was done:

Hiroshima had 100,000 dead. Nagasaki is around 80,000.

Firebombing of Tokyo, using conventional weapons: 120,000.

Battle of Berlin: 200,000 dead, of which 22,000 were civilians, but where a massive number of the ""soldiers"" were actually conscripted elderly men and young boys.

Battle of Stalingrad: 1,700,000 to 2,000,000 casualties, 40,000 of which were civilians that fell to Luftwaffe air raids *in the first week.*

Rape of Nanking: Unknown, on the order of 100,000 to 300,000.

Battle of Okinawa: 120,000 soldiers killed, and 150,000 civilians killed or committed suicide, amounting to 1/4 of the local population. **Bear in mind that this happened immediately prior to the bombings, and were used as a case study as to what could happen if the US invaded the Japanese mainland.**

In addition, by this point in the war, 20,000 Chinese were dying every week under the Japanese occupation of China, which was still ongoing despite the disastrous nature of the Pacific campaign for Japan.

The fact of the matter is that Operation Downfall was something the US military wanted to avoid, particularly in the wake of Okinawa, where the civilians themselves fought off the US forces or committed mass suicide. The Japanese casualty figures for a mainland invasion were a direct extrapolation of what happened on Okinawa.

All told, 60,000,000 people (at least) died in World War II. There was significant evidence at the time that an invasion of Japan would have tacked on another 10,000,000 to 15,000,000.

In addition, the Japanese weren't going to surrender to the terms that the Allies demanded (which themselves were terms that were meant to prevent *another* world war from ever occurring). Ultimately, the bombings were a necessary event that brought an end to probably the most horrific decade our species has ever seen.

The comparison to 9/11 is also not appropriate, because the bombings were between two countries in a declared state of war, and where actual military targets were identified, and also in an era where civilian casualties were much more acceptable. In all likelihood, if we hadn't nuked the two cities, we would have obliterated them with conventional weapons. 9/11, on the other hand, was a direct attack against a target that was entirely civilian in nature, and against another target that was staffed almost entirely by civilians, and in the modern era where civilian casualties are no longer acceptable (largely due to the horrors of WWII, as well as Vietnam and Korea).","&gt; America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.

The other way of ending the war was a full scale land invasion, which would have resulted in many more casualties and destruction than what the final atomic bombings caused.

YOu're completely ignoring the major military significance of those cities.

Hiroshima was a major army depot with many military headquarters, Nagasaki was a major industrial and port city home to many of the nation's war efforts, that had already been targeted before.

You have no way of knowing that civilians would have been spared, they could just have easily have been conscripted to fight.

The Japanese had time and again shown that they *would not* surrender. [That they would candidly fight to the death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima), in Saipan [civilians killed themselves to avoid capture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saipan#Civilian_casualties)

"New here, so please correct me if I am doing anything wrong.

Before I begin I want to point out that this is strictly opinionated and based off of personal observations. Also my grammar isn't the best so please forgive any errors.
 
The main issue I have with marriage is the consequences of ending it. I do understand that this can be avoided to a degree with prenuptial agreements however, they are generally frowned upon. The idea of penalizing someone for ending a failing relationship seems counterproductive to me. This creates a sense of security to those who have refrained from showing or disclosing certain habits or personality traits to their spouse. It also encourages many to ""let themselves go."" By that I mean things such as weight gain, poor hygiene, addictions, etc. 

Secondly, I have seen in many cases where there is just no repairing the relationship, yet the couple remains together due to the financial repercussions of ending their failed marriage. This ultimately leads to a very uncomfortable situation at home, especially for children. It also in many cases leads to infidelity which brings a plethora of problems itself.

All of that said, my opinion is probably a bit biased due to my now divorced parents' marriage, but I am open to hear other arguments on the issue.

Edit: First off, I'd like to thank everyone for their responses. I'd just like to clear up some things I didn't communicate well in my post.

1. By penalizing I wasn't just referring to spousal support and alimony but the legal fees as well.

2. The argument I made was not meant to necessarily knock the institution of marriage because I do think it can work but there does exist many problems with how a failed marriage is dealt with...at least here in the US. My issue is mainly with society's expectation that long term relationships must eventually lead to marriage when it is not for everyone.

Lastly, a few of you pointed out the issues that arise when one spouse stays at home with the children and the other wants out of the marriage down the line. I do now see more of a purpose for it when the intention is to start a family. 
","Marriages ending aren't attempting to penalize people, most of the typical ""downsides"" are actually benefits if you look at them in context. Yes, it sucks that you sometimes need to use the legal system to split your properties in half, but on the plus side, you have a system to ensure you can at least get half of the things the two of you owned as a couple. There are way's that this can be done without marriage at this point of course, but they still hold the same ""drawbacks"". another huge benefit is custody rights.

The argument of ""letting yourself go"" has nothing to do with actually getting married. it has to do with being around someone and not having feeling a strong pressure to find someone to be with. This happens with or without marriage, and its really down to the couple to handle that.

&gt; Secondly, I have seen in many cases where there is just no repairing the relationship, yet the couple remains together due to the financial repercussions of ending their failed marriage. This ultimately leads to a very uncomfortable situation at home, especially for children. It also in many cases leads to infidelity which brings a plethora of problems itself.

The big issue here is that the alternative is much worse. This is usually about the person who has a larger income feeling they deserve more of the assets after the divorce, and not wanting to give that up. Yes, it can really suck, but imagine if assets were not split? Especially if there are children involved, things can get very complicated. Imagine a situation with one stay at home parent, and one employed parent. The couple made this decision because it made sense at the time, but now they are unhappy and wish to divorce. The stay at home parent has very few technical skills from not being a part of the work force, is the primary caretaker of the child and would likely have custody, and if they were not entitled to any of the assets that the employed parent had, they would really have nothing, despite that they were operating and working as a team.

And yes, I am aware that legal fee's are quite high, and that's really the biggest issue. That being said, the legal protection is what makes a marriage a risk more safe. I would be less willing to share a bank account, and all of my possessions with another person if there was not any form of legal protection in place to help deal with that.","Sorry about your parents. That really sucks, and I hope you're able to maintain a healthy relationship with them both. 

About your CMV, I'm not sure I understand what you mean by ""penalizing someone for ending a failing relationship."" When two people divorce, generally the state divides their income &amp; assets in half, and every effort is made to ensure that neither party gets to walk away with everything and leave their spouse with bupkis. Basically the whole point of divorce law is to ensure a fair division of property. This includes alimony &amp; child support if one of the spouses has no ready way to make their own income.

The problem is that it's cheaper for two working adults to share a household, so when they have to go back to living in a single-income household, finances can get tight. There's nothing courts can do about this: it simply flat out costs more to maintain two houses than to maintain just one. I don't think this is a ""penalty"" for divorce so much as it means simply losing the financial benefit of being married (or civil union'd or what have you).",376,"Sorry about your parents.

"*“Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children.” - Marvin Minsky*

So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the far future (maybe even only a few millennia), it will be by integrating ourselves with technology and shedding our fragile organic bodies.

What is the maximum typical lifespan of a sentient organic species? Humans have gone from the invention of writing to the capability to destroy our entire species in just 5,000 years. On a cosmic timescale, that is an instant. Will the Earth still be inhabitable for us in our current states by the time another instant passes? Luckily, we’ve already started primitively engineering and augmenting ourselves, with genetic modification, prosthetic legs, hearts, ears, etc. The technological advances in just the last 100 years (as well as the damage we’ve done to our planet) has been incredible— what will the next 5,000 bring?

Let’s assume for the sake of argument that the nearest sentient species developed on a planet 100 lightyears away. (Just FYI, a quick Google/Wolfram Alpha search tells me the fastest human spacecraft now being designed will go 200km/s, which means it would traverse 100ly in 150,000 years.) Let’s say that, just by chance, this alien civilization achieved our current level of technology very near to us in time— only 10 million years ago. Do you think it's likely that if they existed today they would have organic bodies? Even an alien species so incredibly close to us on a cosmic timescale is almost unthinkably distant in the context of our lifespans as individuals and as a civilization. And organic life forms are just not well-suited for interstellar travel.

Essentially, I think organic life is a means to bootstrap into existence truly immortal technological ‘life’. This is true on Earth and on every other planet as well. And just by the nature of cosmic timescales, it’s much more likely to come into contact with the next evolutionary stage of an alien species than to be lucky enough to catch it in the minuscule period while it’s still fully organic.

"I just read this [article](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-adv-asian-race-tutoring-20150222-story.html#page=1) stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering that only certain minorities have an easier time getting in, while others like asians have a much harder time. It should be based on your grade average and the score you get on your SAT (I'm from Canada so I'm not really sure how SAT score factors into that. I'm used to only your high school grades being counted). If an asian student gets a 90% average, his/her application shouldn't be tossed aside for a black student who only managed to get an 83% average. Maybe in the past affirmative action was necessary, due to racial bias. Nowadays it's completely useless and does nothing but inhibit asians and whites.

I believe your race shouldn't matter when it comes to these things. It's like saying blacks and hispanics are more stupid than asians and whites and therefore should get some help to get into college. Also, before you say that it has to do with economic status, I would like to disagree. My family (including cousins and whatnot) came from very poor circumstances. However, most of my cousins have gone on to get degrees in things like engineering. If you don't do good in school, it's either because your capacity to learn in that certain subject or in general is lower than other people (say being bad at math or English) or you just didn't try hard enough.

Edit: don't downvote me because you disagree with me. Write a post telling me your position and why your opinion differs from mine.

"To say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental physiological differences between men and women that feminists appear to disregard. Now, in my opinion feminism seeks to advocate that anything that men can do, women can also but only when its convenient. To me it seems like feminists want to have their cake and eat it too. I will give a few examples that I always think about to illustrate my point.

1. The Ray Rice incident. What happened was unfortunate and of course he shouldn't have hit his wife. However, if this was Ray hanging out with another football player and knocked him out, this would not have been a story. Its because he punched a woman that this became a big deal. How can the feminist movement suggest ""Men should NEVER lay their hands on a woman"" but still say that men and women are equal. My answer is that its because men are generally stronger than women, but then that's my point. If you are going to advocate that they are equal then they should receive equal treatment. Again, CMV.

2. Rape cases. In college I have been required to watch numerous sexual harassment videos and attend mandatory training seminars on sexual assault. In these videos they always paint the male as a bad guy and its always targeted towards men. Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges. Why is this on the guy? People use the phrase ""Victim Blaming"" and say that its not on the girl regardless of the fact that she drunk. So what if she had gotten drunk and drove her car into a tree. Can she then say ""Maybe that wasn't a good idea"" and then get off the hook?

3. The draft. This one has also bothered me. According to the United States Selective Service Act, all men between ages 18-25 are required to register for the draft and may be picked for military service if the draft were to be implemented. Why are feminists all over the country not outraged about this? Shouldn't it be men AND women that are required to register for the draft? After all, men and women should be able to perform wartime duties equally right? It just seems like people pick and choose when its convenient for gender equality

Of course there are certain things that should be equal. Wages, education, etc. However I feel that a push for gender equality in every aspect of life is fundamentally wrong. CMV!

"I am not a ""tax is theft"" libertarian or even any kind of libertarian. If anything I learn more towards socialist, but I cannot get behind the idea of inheritance tax. Society and sound government requires taxes and I think it's absolutely fair to have taxes on income, sales, purchases, whatever. But for government to come in when a dying person passes on their belongings or money to someone they care about and snatch away a piece of it is a step too far.

I am currently living in Spain and was chatting to some Spanish people today. They mentioned that if you inherit a house you are required to pay a portion of the value as tax. However since Spain is in recession it is extremely difficult to sell the house, and some people are forced to forfeit the property in order to be aligned with the law. This is not the basis of my belief, but it is what motivated me to post this to CMV.

I want someone to give me a good reason to CMV since I think taxes are overall a positive thing. This is just one instance I think is outrageous.

**TL; DR** I understand the need for and support taxation but I cannot support government interference in a dying person's gift to another person. CMV!

EDIT: A few people are bringing up the situation in the US, where inheritance tax doesn't apply to amounts under 5 and a half million. That's fine. Well done USA. But just because it's adjusted and applied like that in the US doesn't make the concept any more agreeable when used throughout the rest of the world. I am not interested in talking about the US example if your argument is based around ""the US has this special set of circumstances and therefore the tax is ok"".

Yeah I can see how that would be a problem. Particularly for people who do not want to sell their loved ones home, but who also don't have the liquid assets available to pay the tax. 

As far as I know, the inheritance tax (on a federal level) in the USA only kicks in once you bequeath or give a relative an amount over 5 million dollars or so. So basically as long as no one in your will gets more than approx 5 million dollars, they do not have to pay any estate tax. As a result, the estate tax affects a very tiny number of people in the US. 

States have their own estate taxes. Some of which only kick in once the person exceeds the federal limit, and some of which are completely independent of the federal limit.

Essentially, at least in the case of the US, the estate tax only affects people who are quite wealthy, or those who are moderately wealthy but only have one or two living relatives. I'm not sure if this changes your view, but it at least shows that the people who are most affected by such laws are usually the people who are ""hurt"" less by them.

So basically as long as no one in your will gets more than approx 5 million dollars, they do not have to pay any estate tax. As a result, the estate tax affects a very tiny number of people in the US. 

States have their own estate taxes. Some of which only kick in once the person exceeds the federal limit, and some of which are completely independent of the federal limit.

Essentially, at least in the case of the US, the estate tax only affects people who are quite wealthy, or those who are moderately wealthy but only have one or two living relatives. I'm not sure if this changes your view, but it at least shows that the people who are most affected by such laws are usually the people who are ""hurt"" less by them.

"Firstly- I'm a Brit, so if I'm missing some massive cultural point of order here apologies!


While having a conversation over the phone about a movie (the name of the movie never came up, so I will preface this post by saying I haven't actually seen said movie) in which a black student at an Ivy league school started a radio station directed at ""White People"", during this conversation a couple of things came up such as how the black students disapproved of a house of only black students being changed in the future so that students would mix normally (which sounds to me like an attempt to abolish outdated segregatory measures- although again I haven't seen the movie).


This is the context of my post- apparently this film culminates with a party in which people are invited to show up dressed as stereotypical elements of culture framed in an attempt to trap the students into going to a party founded on fundamentally racist ideals. The movie then ends with clips from colleges over America having these kinds of parties. Now I can't imagine many people are foreign to party themes which now could be labelled as cultural appropriation- the most common being ""Cowboys and Indians"" which are nowadays quick to be labelled as **racist**. 

I guess I come to the opinion in my title from several ideas which probably all need to be challenged to change the view to which they lead. 

1- Displaying stereotypes for any purpose (even one as basic as to have a good time) ultimately does no harm, causing offense or even in extreme cases devaluing the root culture (although I would dispute that) is not the same as racism which is a prejudice against another person due to the colour of their skin- there is no discrimination here, other than bruised feelings no harm is done, Stereotypes are used in comedy against pretty much every imaginable definable group. 

2- Britain (arguably more so than America) is a cultural melting pot, appropriation goes both ways- India started playing Cricket for example, the person I was on the phone with raised the point that appropriation is particularly when something is taken from a culture without giving a contribution back to the culture from which it was taken- which makes sense. However I would argue that the use of stereotypes in this way is not taking anything from the culture in the first place- stereotypes only occasionally reflect current cultures often far removed from the circumstance of their use. It would be like arguing against a BDSM theme for a party because we are taking from that sub-culture without contributing anything (Before people jump out and point out the strawman here those involved in the BDSM community have faced a persecution and prejudice for their activities which although are changeable- which skin colour is not in most cases the basic premise is still close enough to be metaphorically accurate) 

3- Cultures benefit from cultural appropriation- it raises awareness and increases immersion in the native culture.

That's not really cultural appropriation.

People get bent out of shape about it when people take bits and pieces of a culture out of context, without understanding it. Then, usually, those contextless items are commodified without the originating culture's consent or benefit.

Imagine the following scerario: some aliens decide to drop in on humanity, and they decide to wear coture dresses with pope hats and sneakers because they like keeping their jimmies cool, value comfort, and that's just a nice hat. Everybody everywhere would be snickering at their choice, but they would haughtily remind us that they are the more advanced species, so they are doing it right. Meanwhile, they take their dresses and pope hats back to the central galaxy and make more money than the earth is worth on their ""fantastic artisanship"" that they totally didn't just take directly from a Payless store. Earth remains disconnected from the galactic sphere, and all the dubbed virtual reality simulations they *do* send us back portray aliens dressed up as ""humans"" in their dresses and pope hats, and we all like cheese because the aliens found that hilarious. Those coture dresses are dismissed as 'tribal costumes' and we are the backward butts of jokes -- not the people who wore a damn pope hat and sneakers and called it 'cool'.

Okay, so that's pretty absurd, but that's exactly what we tend to do to other cultures right here on earth.

To bring it back to your original BDSM party example, if people culturally appropriated from BDSM culture, it would suck. It would consist of taking things out of context, not caring about the important underlying things that make BDSM safe(r) and getting it (likely deadly) wrong. People would end up going to the hospital because they didn't know how to tie the ropes right, and didn't think it important to learn how before their hand turned black from constriction or something. They'd do things like wear a locking gag without having a safe command (like, ""hey spotter, if I pound my fist three times, that means break out the emergency shears and get this thing off me!"") so they end up choking to death. Now, everybody forms the opinion that BDSM is unsafe and should be banned, because just look at what happened!? *Obviously* that culture has something horribly wrong with it. That's cultural appropriation. Playing cricket worldwide is not.","I think you are misunderstanding the point of cultural appropriation.  It's not that only a member of a given culture has any right to use objects, designs, patterns, etc. that come from that culture.

The biggest problem is when other people borrow one piece of a culture without taking a moment to understand context.

A prime example is the [war bonnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_bonnet), as it's frequently appropriated.  

In reality, a war bonnet is an object with deep cultural, or even spiritual importance.  They're used almost exclusively for ceremonial purposes.  The feathers aren't just given away, they're earned by acts of valor, or other service to the tribe.

When people wear them just as some sort of [fancy hat](https://www.google.com/search?q=war+bonnet+hipster&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=839&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIkeC0naXCxwIVCBGSCh3Q1wn-), that shows a deep lack of respect for another culture.  It's not just that you're taking an object, it's that you couldn't be bothered to even simply understand what that object actually means.

It would be somewhat similar to someone from another culture coming along, and deciding they like the way our western [military dress uniforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_uniform#/media/File:Household_Cavalry.jpg) look, right down to the sword and the medals, so they were going to go wear that to a party.  Not only would they probably get a lot of the details wrong, they're unintentionally pretending to be something they're not, and pretending to have earned an honor they haven't.

The other type of culture appropriation might be closer to what you're saying is ok, but I believe it's still a problem.

It's when people try to imitate a culture, but fail so miserably that they end up creating a caricature instead.  This is what you're talking about with things like ""Cowboys and Indians""  parties.

We can imagine what if people did the same thing with British culture.  What if everybody's idea of a British person was Dick Van Dyke's character from Mary Poppins, stupid accent and all?  What if every time you met someone, they had to make some stupid joke in a Cockney accent, because that movie was the only thing they knew about your culture?

Right now, that Dick Van Dyke stereotype exists, but it's different from more problematic stereotypes for one really big reason, which is that no one actually believes it's true, not really.  People have a huge amount of exposure to British culture, with TV shows, movies, news, and music made by British people introducing people to other aspects of British culture all the time.

The cultures that have problems with cultural appropriation don't have that big advantage.  Often the vast majority of the exposure they get is in the form of stereotypes, which means they're always fighting uphill against misconceptions and misunderstandings in order to actually give any sort of realistic information to others about their culture.

"Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, for example:

1. My child, my choice. Well, yes. And this is the closest one to a valid argument, IMO. But of course we put limits on what parents are allowed to do and choose for their children; you can't deprive your child of food or education (in the US) and be allowed to keep your child, so clearly it is NOT all your choice. While refusing vaccines is nowhere near on that level, not EVERY possible choice is equally acceptable, because your child is a person, not a piece of property. If the child had the capacity to refuse, I might be swayed, but unfortunately young babies can't understand vaccines on any reasonable level. And, more importantly, it IS still your choice under school vaccination schemes; you can choose to homeschool your child, or send them to private schools that don't care. Those choices aren't available to everyone and that's unfortunate (for far more important reasons than this), but...that's our current system anyway. Being rich gets you all kinds of benefits. I don't think this is different from being able to buy better medical care, better schools, better food, private tutors, and worlds more for your child if you have the resources (I do support basic income, which would alleviate this issue, but that's neither here nor there as we haven't got it). Public schools are a governmental service, and there are rules about who can and cannot use them. I think it is fine to say only vaccinated (or medically exempt) people can use them.

2. Not everyone can get vaccinated. That's why doctors are able to issue waivers for those not medically right for vaccination. This already happens and should continue.

3. Vaccines are dangerous. Not as dangerous as rampant infection. Honestly this is its own debate...But suffice it to say you are going to need some pretty major evidence to possibly CMV. I don't think it exists, but I won't rule it out. I don't really want to talk about vaccine efficacy as it has been done to death, but I guess if there's some truly amazing evidence...

4. Everyone is entitled to an education. They still are. Any unvaccinated child either needs to attend a non-public education option, be homeschooled or eschooled, provide a medical certificate that says they shouldn't be vaccinated, or get the shots. I don't necessarily have a strong view on the best way to handle noncompliance, and don't know enough about policy to say what would be most effective and just. Maybe fines for the parents? The same punishment as parents who refuse to send their kids to school or teach them at home for other reasons? I would not support removing the child from the home or incarcerating the parents, or any other severe punishment.

What would change my view: evidence that such a policy would have clear public health risks, would unavoidably keep children from getting an education, or would have some other major negative effect on society. I also am open to the idea that it is fundamentally unjust, though it doesn't seem that way to me right now.

Edit: My post focuses mainly on why I think mandatory vaccination isn't bad, but it occurred to me that it might be helpful to say why I think it's good. Mainly, I think it's good because it protects those who cannot be vaccinated and the minority of children for whom the vaccine was ineffective or wore off sooner than it ""should have"" based on medical guidelines. Children should be safe at school, and I think this promotes safety in a significant way--since children can die of preventable illness.

Edit2: If vaccines are prohibitively expensive and can't be obtained for free, this system is pretty shit for poor families. In my area you can get free vaccines in certain conditions, which are very lenient. If this isn't true everywhere in the US (and it almost certainly  isn't), it should be before vaccines are made mandatory.

Edit3: Going to bed now, will respond to new posts tomorrow. If it blows up, I might not get to everyone, but I will try to address any new points that are brought to the table.","As a teacher, I agree with you.  However, in my school law class, we discussed this issue at length and so I'll try to 'change your view' on one part regarding religion.

As other have noted, school is mandatory in the United States.  (Ever since the Supreme Court case *Society of Sisters* in 1925)  Sure, there are exemptions such as private tutoring or private school, but these are not feasible for all people.  Without any doubt, there are people who, due to circumstance, can only attend public school and are mandated to do so by Federal law. 

Now, courts have certainly tried to balance the liberty of the parents/student and the greater good in cases regarding education.  One Constitutional issue that gets particular scrutiny is that relating to religion in First Amendment.  First, there is the establishment clause, which basically says government cannot establish any sort of religion.  Second, there is the free exercise clause which basically says government cannot prevent persons from freely practicing their religion. 

Now, we look at the issue at hand.  Some religions expressly prohibit vaccination, and forcing them to get a vaccination would almost certainly been seen as a violation of the free exercise clause.  

Therefore, I wish to change your view on just this point:  Medical AND Religious exemptions must be considered, or else this idea (similar to Jerry Brown's new law in California) will be struck down by courts on First Amendment grounds.  ","As much as I hate defending the anti-vaccine crowd, I think the problem with mandatory vaccination for public school is that school is also compulsory. Ever since No Child Left Behind, education has been mandatory for all children until 16 or 18 (can't remember). Now the same people who demandon't children be sent to school also demand that in order to go to school, they must be vaccinated. 

Now, now you might say, that's only for public schools, what about private schools and home/eschooling? There's a problem with that too. Roughly 40% of children in the US live in single parent home, which rules out the prospect of homeschooling and eschooling becomes unviable because it's illegal to leave your kids alone at home. You also have a large percentage of the population who can't afford or don't have access to private schools. The amount of overlap here has the potential to be very high, especially in poor neighborhoods. 

So, now we have a segment of the population for whom public school is the only option. What are the odds that some of these people do not want their kids vaccinated, for whatever reason (ignorance usually, but that's not the point)? Pretty high. So now the question becomes, are we willing to fine and or imprison parents because they don't want their kid to get a vaccine and therefore won't send them to school?

"You may have seen news that BlackLivesMatter protesters interrupted a Bernie Sanders campaign event in Seattle. I think this was wrong to do, because he has fought for civil rights before and his economic platform greatly fights for the poor and working class, in which black people are disproportionately represented. 

I also think many of the things that were said by these protesters were racist or at least bigoted in their own right, like criticizing Bernie Sanders for being white. 

Why did these protesters think that this was a good thing to do? Why did they think it helps their cause? ","I am going to start with the caveat that I am not trying to change your overall opinion. I am ONLY trying change your opinion on this particular segment of your reasoning: ""...this was wrong to do, *because he has fought for civil rights before and his economic platform greatly fights for the poor and working class, in which black people are disproportionately represented*."" I totally agree that Bernie Sanders has one of the better records on civil rights among the candidates who are running. However, that makes him a better target, not a worse one. It would be completely pointless to show up at a Donald Trump rally and say something about Black Lives Matter (or any racial issue). Donald Trump is a clear and overt racist. There is nothing that can be done to make Donald Trump a good candidate on race. Bernie Sanders is a relatively good candidate on race, but many people who have race as the primary political issue that they care about believe that he could be better. By targeting Sanders, who is already a relatively good candidate on race, people can put pressure on him to make race a primary element of his campaign and to refine his opinions on policies regarding racism and social justice. 

I don't know what the motivations of these women necessarily were (their message was VERY muddied by a lot of factors) and I don't think their actions were appropriate or helpful at this time. But I think the idea that Bernie Sanders should be free of criticism on racial issues specifically because he has a decent history on them is silly. If people who are not satisfied with his record at this time criticize him and he steps up to the plate, they might have a candidate they actually want to vote for.","I got lunch today with a group of friends who range from liberals focused issues facing the black community to more radical Black liberation politics.

"Before I begin, I would like to point something out. I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. ""That means that marriage isn't as special and you can just drop out freely whenever you want"". I don't see this as a viable argument, because if someone is going to leave, then they have a reason to. Even if its a bad reason, or a really good reason, making the person stay by the threat of losing lots of money and/or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse and cause the couple to fight more and more. 

I see no reason whatsoever why anyone should be able to take legal action if their spouse decides to leave then. If someone leaves a marriage, it means they are unhappy with it, or have lost feelings for the other person. And like I said in my first statement, making the person stay in marriage until a joint divorce is (if ever) made by the threat of the person leaving losing a lot of money and/or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse, leaving 1 or both of the people suffering for years. 

Another reason why this is bad is if one person is unhappy in their marriage, and the spouse is forcing them to stay by means of threatening legal action, will leave the unhappy spouse in a terrible marriage for years, or possibly for the rest of their lives.

"I've been studying Linguistics as an undergraduate for about 8 months or so now, so this one is important to me academically. In discussions of language, there are typically two camps into which people fall: prescriptivism, and descriptivism. Prescriptivists, think your typical grammarian, David Crystal, Lynne Truss, etc., correcting people's grammar, getting fussy about punctuation, insisting upon proper pronunciation. At the heart of prescriptivism is the idea that there is a way that language *should* be spoken. Descriptivism, on the other hand, argues that there is no such thing as ""correct"" language, that what prescriptivists call ""mistakes"" are just non-standard varieties, and that we shouldn't ever make judgements about people's language.

Linguistics is whole-heartedly and almost exceptionlessly (AFAIK) descriptivist, and as a student, I recognise its importance. The view that there is any single ""correct"" variety of language is obviously misleading from the beginning: which variety? Who says X dialect is better than Y dialect? And judgements against language, I-believe-it-was-Peter Trudgill argued, are actually judgements against people's social class, as supposedly ""incorrect"" language features are often described by the upper classes as being used by the lower classes. And I do mostly agree with it.

But. While I understand all this, I find it difficult to truly shake off the claws of prescriptivism. In particular, the idea that there isn't any ""correct"" language. For example:

""He _went_ to the shops""
""He _gone_ to the shops""

I can accept that in some English dialects, the past participle of ""go"" is ""gone"" instead of ""went"". That's not a mistake. But then take a sentence like:

""Shops went the he to""

This isn't syntactically valid: it doesn't parse as a sentence. You might just be understood, but more likely you would confuse everybody with this sentence, so it fails as communication. If this sentence both isn't a valid sentence, and can't be understood, what other word to describe it than ""incorrect""? It can't be a valid form of language if almost nobody understands it, surely.

So what I'm really seeking, is to understand how sentences like the above can fit into the framework of descriptivism, and for someone to convince me that we can't describe sentences like the above as ""wrong"". Please VCM.

Descriptivism does not say that all mistakes are just non-standard varieties. What it is really does is identify dialectical differences and find the underlying structures of grammatical language. So, descriptivism is *describing* the universal rules of a language, whereas prescriptivism is *prescribing* an ideal standard for a language. 

In regards to your example sentences, in english, a sentence needs to have an SVO structure in order to be grammatical. This is not only a prescriptive view, but also descriptive, because it is an observable phenomenon that is universal across the english language. So when you use the sentences: 

*""He went to the shop""* and *""He gone to the shop""*, both are following an SVO pattern, and are thus grammatical in terms of descriptivism. 

However, when you consider the sentence ""Shops went the he to"", this would be considered ungrammatical by descriptivists, because it uses an OVS structure, which is not grammatical in English. 

So I think the main thing that might be confusing you is the thought that descriptivism sees mistakes as variances. While this is *sometimes* the case, descriptivists do still acknowledge that language has rules that need to be followed in order to be understood. So, descriptive and prescriptive rules do sometimes agree with each other, especially when it comes to base grammar rules such as word order (like above) and pluralization (i.e. ""I have three apple"" is ungrammatical both in the descriptive and prescriptive viewpoints). But when it comes to finer points of language, they tend to disagree. Take for example, the word ""funner"". Prescriptivists will tell you that it is not a word, whereas descriptivists will tell you that it is, because the affixation of -er to the end of a description word means it is *""more so""* than something else. 

tl;dr: Descriptivism *describes* language as it is used, Prescriptivism *prescribes* language as it ""should"" be used. ","Instead of *correct* and *incorrect*, think *standard* and *non-standard*.

"Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, is it looked down on and dismissed as anecdotal evidence for someone to share an experience of theirs? I quite enjoy listening to anecdotal evidence to get new perspectives I wouldn't have thought of or haven't heard before.

I understand that in an anecdotal case it is not scientific because it cannot be replicated and held to control standards, but I don't think this is grounds for dismissing the case as merely anecdotal and not worth mentioning. Am I wrong about this?

"The universe exists, and came in to being somehow. 

Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, and roughly *how* it did, but what caused it to come in to being is a unanswered question - one we may never answer.

There are others that believe God brought the Universe in to being (that is, an all powerful entity was the first-mover, setting the universe in motion). 

But if God is all powerful and infinite, we have no idea what His/Her/its nature is, and couldn't possibly know, as mortal, finite beings. What is the difference between saying we don't know how the universe came in to being, and saying that this entity that we don't know the nature of, and couldn't possibly comprehend, brought the universe in to being? Aren't they equally nebulous beliefs?

How does believing that God brought the universe in to being differentiate your beliefs from those who would say we don't know how the universe was brought in to being? Aren't they pretty much the same belief?

"Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, for example:

1. My child, my choice. Well, yes. And this is the closest one to a valid argument, IMO. But of course we put limits on what parents are allowed to do and choose for their children; you can't deprive your child of food or education (in the US) and be allowed to keep your child, so clearly it is NOT all your choice. While refusing vaccines is nowhere near on that level, not EVERY possible choice is equally acceptable, because your child is a person, not a piece of property. If the child had the capacity to refuse, I might be swayed, but unfortunately young babies can't understand vaccines on any reasonable level. And, more importantly, it IS still your choice under school vaccination schemes; you can choose to homeschool your child, or send them to private schools that don't care. Those choices aren't available to everyone and that's unfortunate (for far more important reasons than this), but...that's our current system anyway. Being rich gets you all kinds of benefits. I don't think this is different from being able to buy better medical care, better schools, better food, private tutors, and worlds more for your child if you have the resources (I do support basic income, which would alleviate this issue, but that's neither here nor there as we haven't got it). Public schools are a governmental service, and there are rules about who can and cannot use them. I think it is fine to say only vaccinated (or medically exempt) people can use them.

2. Not everyone can get vaccinated. That's why doctors are able to issue waivers for those not medically right for vaccination. This already happens and should continue.

3. Vaccines are dangerous. Not as dangerous as rampant infection. Honestly this is its own debate...But suffice it to say you are going to need some pretty major evidence to possibly CMV. I don't think it exists, but I won't rule it out. I don't really want to talk about vaccine efficacy as it has been done to death, but I guess if there's some truly amazing evidence...

4. Everyone is entitled to an education. They still are. Any unvaccinated child either needs to attend a non-public education option, be homeschooled or eschooled, provide a medical certificate that says they shouldn't be vaccinated, or get the shots. I don't necessarily have a strong view on the best way to handle noncompliance, and don't know enough about policy to say what would be most effective and just. Maybe fines for the parents? The same punishment as parents who refuse to send their kids to school or teach them at home for other reasons? I would not support removing the child from the home or incarcerating the parents, or any other severe punishment.

What would change my view: evidence that such a policy would have clear public health risks, would unavoidably keep children from getting an education, or would have some other major negative effect on society. I also am open to the idea that it is fundamentally unjust, though it doesn't seem that way to me right now.

Edit: My post focuses mainly on why I think mandatory vaccination isn't bad, but it occurred to me that it might be helpful to say why I think it's good. Mainly, I think it's good because it protects those who cannot be vaccinated and the minority of children for whom the vaccine was ineffective or wore off sooner than it ""should have"" based on medical guidelines. Children should be safe at school, and I think this promotes safety in a significant way--since children can die of preventable illness.

Edit2: If vaccines are prohibitively expensive and can't be obtained for free, this system is pretty shit for poor families. In my area you can get free vaccines in certain conditions, which are very lenient. If this isn't true everywhere in the US (and it almost certainly  isn't), it should be before vaccines are made mandatory.

Edit3: Going to bed now, will respond to new posts tomorrow. If it blows up, I might not get to everyone, but I will try to address any new points that are brought to the table.","So I do think this policy I justified, but I don't think it's a good mechanism for mandatory vaccination.

The people who insist on not vaccinating their children do so because they think it would be harmful for their child, and some of them probably hold this belief strong enough so that they would not enroll their children in school. Are anti-vaxxers really the people you want homeschooling children? The comparison here is, with mandatory vaccinations, hundreds of kids have their lives ruined by leaving school each year. Without them, maybe once every decade, less than a hundred kids will get sick for a few weeks. 

But the problem is also worse than that, because this also plays into a lot of anti-vaxxer rhetoric. A lot of it relies on exploiting people's fears of the government. Mandatory vaccines only make that seem worse. Additionally, it makes these people even less trusting of the government, meaning that they are more likely to shut themselves of from outside streams of information. So it forces many anti-vaxxers into even more of an echo chamber. One of the must successful ways to spread information is to have anti-vaxxers have a friend or a neighbor who can discuss these things with them. The easiest way to prevent that from happening is by forcing them further away from the rest of society.","As much as I hate defending the anti-vaccine crowd, I think the problem with mandatory vaccination for public school is that school is also compulsory. Ever since No Child Left Behind, education has been mandatory for all children until 16 or 18 (can't remember). Now the same people who demandon't children be sent to school also demand that in order to go to school, they must be vaccinated. 

Now, now you might say, that's only for public schools, what about private schools and home/eschooling? There's a problem with that too. Roughly 40% of children in the US live in single parent home, which rules out the prospect of homeschooling and eschooling becomes unviable because it's illegal to leave your kids alone at home.

"Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. 

Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and don't even know what the president DOES. They have the right to vote with literally no requirements other than surviving for 18 years and registering. They can vote.

Person B is basically Albert freaking Einstein. They have the highest known IQ in the world. They know every position of all the candidates and can vote with the utmost qualification. Before they do this, they must pass a citizenship test. They do, and they can vote.

Person C is just as dumb as Person A. They're not sure why people speak French in Montreal despite having lived in Canada their entire life. They moved to the US and are unable to pass a citizenship test after living in the US for the requisite time. They cannot vote.

Only Person B is qualified to vote, yet Persons A and B can both do so.

Why not have Person A take the same test as Persons B and C before they can vote?

"America has accomplished nothing in its history that makes it worth of such widespread pride and love by its people (particularly this time of the year). Every event that Americans glorify either has a disgusting background to it or is grossly misread by most people. These are some examples:

-The American Revolution: It did involve great thinkers and advancement of political philosophy, but the French did it better, and American Revolution was an overreaction to British enforcement of fair taxes that paid for the 7 Years War to protect Americans. 
-Industrial revolution: Granted high developments in technology and economic prowess were built on slavery, child labor, discrimination against immigrants, poverty and greedy, amoral robber barons and corrupt politicians. 
Civil War: The fact that it needed to happen and that a flag that represents those who fought to defend slavery is still being flown and celebrated is disappointing. 
World War 2: Significant military power, certainly helped turn the tide, still killed 300,000 civilians with atomic weapons and put Asian Americans in camps (with little reparation that came way too late).

Of course there are worse countries in the world, but current day America is a wreck. Frequent mass shootings that don't really happen in other developed countries, continued high race tensions, religious fundamentalism in the South and a poor education system. So tell me CMV, is there any reason to celebrate or be proud of my country?

&gt;The American Revolution: It did involve great thinkers and advancement of political philosophy, but the French did it better, 

WHAT?!

The French Revolution was a disaster!  Their first elected government was [overthrown by a violent mob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_August_\(French_Revolution\)) and [started a war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars) that would persist for a decade to come.  Their domestic government quickly turned into [a totalitarian dictatorship that murdered tens of thousands of political enemies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror) and was then succeeded by a [reactionary coup d'etat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermidorian_Reaction).

And after all that, what did France get?  [Napoleon,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon) who was a dictatorial and warmongering emperor.

The American Revolution was followed by peace, the establishment of an actually elected government, and when problems did arise, a peaceful solution in the form of the Constitutional Convention.  The transition from Adams to Jefferson after the brutally contentious election of 1800 was probably the first peaceful transition of power between political adversaries in a sovereign state the world had seen for over a thousand years.

&gt;and American Revolution was an overreaction to British enforcement of fair taxes that paid for the 7 Years War to protect Americans.

It was a mutual escalation, with colonial tax protests being met with [excessive reprisals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerable_Acts) from the British crown.  [Many within the British Parliament sympathized with the Americans](https://almostchosenpeople.wordpress.com/2009/12/17/edmund-burke-and-the-american-revolution/) and thought the government was being foolish, even if sentiment was generally that they shouldn't have gone to war.

&gt;-Industrial revolution: Granted high developments in technology and economic prowess were built on slavery, child labor, discrimination against immigrants, poverty and greedy, amoral robber barons and corrupt politicians.

I think you're putting a far more negative gloss on this than is justified.  First, most of the massive economic growth of the US took place after the Civil War, and were not primarily driven by slave labor at any point.  Second, the effects of that economic growth on human wellbeing across the country today are enormous.  Standards of living are very high in the US today, and there is no country on Earth which has industrialized without having poor labor market conditions in its early industrial period.

Also, immigrants to America in this era weren't dupes.  They moved here because America really did offer opportunity to make a life for yourself that wasn't available anywhere else in the world at the time.

&gt;Civil War: The fact that it needed to happen and that a flag that represents those who fought to defend slavery is still being flown and celebrated is disappointing.

Obviously slavery is a dark mark on American history, and I have nothing to say in its defense, except that the north could have let the south secede, and a major reason that it did not play out that way was a moral opposition to slavery.

&gt;World War 2: Significant military power, certainly helped turn the tide, still killed 300,000 civilians with atomic weapons and put Asian Americans in camps (with little reparation that came way too late).

Again, nothing to say in defense of internment, but will note that the US did not start WWII, and did not fully enter it until it was attacked by the Japanese and declared war on by the Germans.  War is nasty business though, and if you're looking for a war fought by ethical means, you'll never find one.

Current day America has problems, but we're not a wreck.  Crime is way down, our economic situation is doing much better than most other developed countries,  and we still have a reasonably functional government which allows for peaceful political discourse and meaningfully defends Americans' civil rights.

"I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are far from north american culture. You're expected to not reveal too much when dressing. I completely understand that everyone has the right to dress how they want to but I just don't feel like if you are giving yourself to your SO then you shouldn't let others see your body.

 To me it is just a very special thing between two people to let the other person see and explore each other that no one else has. Too much cleavage or wearing no bras with thin shirts that let you clearly see the nipple and then she hugs other people makes me feel very uncomfortable. I would love to change my view, as I stand by the right that anyone can wear whatever they want, but this idea is just so integrated in my head after all my life living in it that I can't seem to shut it off
","&gt;To me it is just a very special thing between two people to let the other person see and explore each other that no one else has.

Is this really your motivation, though? The moments you share with yourselves are that much more special if your significant other doesn't wear revealing clothing? Or is this simply what you say to rationalize your uncomfortable feelings to avoid acknowledging that your feelings are your own problem? 

In my experience when talking about this issue and similar ones with others, I find this actually isn't what they mean. What they really mean is they do not want other people looking at their significant other -- not that the time they spend together is actually more special. Really the emotion you are feeling here is one of two things: selfishness or jealousy. 

You are either being selfish in not wanting other people to see your significant other in that light, or you are jealous that other people are able to see her in that way while you are not (at least in those moments). 

So the underlying motivation here is not that you want to preserve some special connection, but rather you want to avoid uncomfortable feelings caused by your selfishness and jealousy. You will still have a special connection, once you get over these feelings, because the special connection you share is not based on something so superficial. ","Okay OP, I might have an answer for you. If you truly want to change your view it's going to take a while and even then it might still not be fully changed.   
So you say you believe that people should be able to wear what they want. That's good, as all people should have that right. Now the biggest issue that you have with it is that it makes you feel uncomfortable. Now I can't make you not feel uncomfortable seeing your hypothetical girlfriend wearing revealing clothing outdoors, only you can.  
  
Being uncomfortable with what your SO wears I think stems from jealousy. You feel that only you should have the right to see that part of your SO. But that's not how the world works these days. You need to invest some trust into your hypothetical SO and realize that you're the only man she wants to be with. Now why would a person with a SO wear revealing clothing? Because it could just be there style, or it makes the feel good about themselves. But you need to try and not be so possessive of your hypothetical SO, they are a person too and they are going to do what they want. And if you're dating someone you should have enough respect for them to let them wear what they want, because when it comes down to it you don't control their actions.   
  
  
Now to change your feelings, the only solution that I have for you is honestly, to buck up. Changing an opinion that is ingrained into you culture is incredibly hard, but it is possible. I had to change how I felt uncomfortable with wearing certain things or discussing certain topics. And though it felt wrong when I did it, the more I kept at it the less wrong it felt. And about after 4 months I found that my feeling on the matter had changed. So if you want to change how you feel, you have to let your SO wear what they want. And if you don't want to change that's fine, but I personally would find an overly jealous SO to be undesirable.    
    
Hope that helps!",393,"&gt;To me it is just a very special thing between two people to let the other person see and explore each other that no one else has.

"The expense of a higher education has been a hot button issue for a number of years but the fact that students take on huge loans and graduate with huge sums of debt is a function of their own suboptimal decisions. [According to google](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=average%20annual%20college%20tuition&amp;es_th=1) the average tuition for private colleges is $31,231 per year. Assuming the worst case and a student pays full sticker price, that's around 125k in debt. But with almost all private schools, there are plentiful scholarship and grant opportunities. Even for students who support themselves (meaning no financial help from their parents), these options make the 125k number far less. This forgets the fact that according to the same source, students can attend an in-state university for just shy of 10,000, for a far more affordable (and worst case) of 40k. And this is without considering alternatives to college.

"Though my personal political views match those of Bernie Sanders much more than Hillary Clinton, I believe nominating Bernie could ultimately be very damaging for the progressive cause. My main concern with nominating Sanders is that he will alienate all voters except for the left and the end result will be a 48-state Reagan v. Mondale style steamrolling. A GOP presidency, possible supermajority in both houses and 1-3 supreme court nominations could be enough to nullify the limited progress we've had under Obama. 

A Clinton presidency would probably look very similar to Obama's, and come with a lot of disappointments. I do think it's possible that we might see progress towards things like a single-payer healthcare system that progressives have wanted all along.

"As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one:

**They reduce the extent of any injuries caused by a bike accident**

Bike helmets are proven to make any injuries obtained greatly decreased. The effectiveness of helmets are found to be 85-88% in preventing serious injury. About 70-80% of accidents involve some damage to the head. It is estimated that if children ages 5-15 were forced to wear a helmet, 39,000 to 45,000 head injuries would be avoided, along with 18,000-55,000 face and scalp injuries. I could go on and on with these, but I don't have that much time. If you want more proof, just google ""bike helmet facts"". I've also listed my sources below. 

Sources: 

http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/ped_bike/docs/b_helmetlaws.pdf

https://sites.google.com/site/bicyclehelmetmythsandfacts/ (NSFW, for some reason there is a picture of a man and woman riding naked. Still good stuff on this page, though)

**Helmets do not interfere with riding the bike.**

Helmets, if they are the correct size, do not get in the way while riding the bike. The only thing they can do is possibly disturb the airflow, but special aerodynamic helmets are made for this, if that is that big of a deal to a person. 

Common Counterarguments:

**It messes up my hair!/It is uncomfortable!/It makes me look like a dork!**

I always hear this, but, you know what, none of these are that big of a deal! I would much rather endure a little discomfort than get a possibly permanent injury to my head.

**But I haven't fallen off my bike in, like, years!**

This one. I hate when people say this. Just because you haven't gotten in a crash in a while does not mean that you are exempt from ever crashing again. This is especially true when travelling on a main road when other cars are a factor.

**They're so expensive!!**

No, just no. An average bike helmet will cost about 10 bucks or less. If you can afford a bike, then you can afford a helmet

Alright, that's it for now. Please CMV! 

Edit: My view has been changed. Many of you have brought up good points, but I don't have time to individually comment on each of your comments.

Helmets
Head injuries going up with increased helmet usage.  Between 1991 and 2001 two things happened: helmet use among cyclists soared, and head injuries soared along with it. Head injuries among cyclists went up by 10% on a simple basis, but when we factor in the dramatic decrease in the number of cyclists during that period, head injuries effectively went up by 51%. (New York Times, 2001)  Incidentally, from this we can figure that there was a 27% reduction in cycling.  (e.g., 1000 injuries + 10% = 1100 injuries; 1100 injuries ÷ 1.51 = 728 injuries; 1000 to 728 is a ~27% reduction.)

Head injuries didn't go up because helmets turned would-be fatalities into simple injuries.  One reader complained that the reason that head injuries went up as helmet use went up was that fewer cyclists died as a result of wearing helmets, and those who didn't die were simply injured instead, making the head injury stats go up.  It's a nice theory, but it's dead wrong.  Cyclist fatalities have shot straight up with increased helmet use, just as cycling injuries have.  Cyclist deaths went from 843 to 728 from 1991 to 2001. (Traffic Safety Facts 2001, PDF, p. 17)  However, as per the NYT article above, the number of people biking went down 27% during this period, so we would expect the 843 deaths in 1991 to shrink to 615 deaths in 2001 even without increased helmet use.  But as helmet use surged, deaths didn't drop to 615, they actually went to 728.  That's effectively an 18% increase in the number of cycling deaths as helmet use surged.  And for those who complain that we can't look at specific years because of year-to-year variance, let's compare the five-year-average number of deaths from 1987-1991 and 1997-2001.  That gives us 879 to 750 deaths, or an effective increase in biking deaths of 17% as helmet use surged.

* Bicycle helmets may have some protective value, but not nearly as much as has been claimed, or most people seem to think.
* Wearing a helmet does nothing to prevent you from being hit by a car.
* Real bicycle safety involves learning how to ride properly.
* Crash helmets could easily save more lives for motorists than bicyclists.
* Helmet laws can result in the targeting of minorities, discourage cycling, make cycling more dangerous for those who remain, and shift the blame in car-bike collisions to helmetless cyclists even if it was the motorist who was at fault.

"Let me start off by saying that I am not against legal immigration in anyway, and am only against illegal immigration. I believe that illegal immigrants should not be given amnesty for plenty of reasons.

A) They broke the law, and should be punished, not rewarded, for doing so. There are legal ways to immigrate into the US, and just because it is harder to do so does not mean you can ignore the law when it is convenient. 

B) Illegal immigration depresses wages and lowers working conditions. They are willing to work for less, and are much less likely to complain when they are abused. Many businesses take advantage of such people to save costs, and treat their illegal immigrant workers unfairly. 

C) The people coming in negatively effect the community by committing crime. According to USA Today, [they represent just 3.5% of the U.S. population, undocumented immigrants represented 7% of federal prison sentences following convictions on charges of sexual abuse, 9% of murders, 12% of assaults and 30% of kidnappings in 2013.
](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/16/voices-gomez-undocumented-immigrant-crime-san-francisco-shooting/30159479/) 

**EDIT** I only googled ""how much crime to illegal immigrants commit"" and only looked at the first statistic I found in the article, so I do concede this point after reading my own source more clearly, since it states later in the article that
""There's no evidence that immigrants are either more or less likely to commit crimes than anyone else in the population,"" Janice Kephart, a CIS researcher, said last week on the PBS NewsHour.


D) Most importantly, by not having a tough stance on illegal immigration, it further encourages illegal immigration. There is always going to be motivation for illegal immigration, so as a country, we should do our best to discourage that behavior. By not actively discouraging illegal immigration, people would be stupid not to try to illegally immigrate.


**EDIT:**
My view has changed in the sense that I no longer believe that all illegal immigrants should be deported as soon as possible, and you can see my post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3gt76g/cmv_illegal_immigrants_should_be_deported_and_not/cu1b3o9)

Ok, but you haven't explained why that punishment *has* to be deportation. Not only is it going to cost the US billions of dollars tracking down and deporting 11 million people, it leaves off the table other methods of punishment. Punishments that could include:

Paying a large fine to the taxpayers

Community service

Larger amount of paycheck going to payroll taxes (social security)

Lower on the tier list for government job prospects

Just deporting them all isn't good for the country. Certainly not as good a deal as having them pay us money. This also doesn't deal with the problem that most of the jobs they do Americans don't wan to do anyway. And this:

Do you really expect people to just say, ""Oh, since it is against the law for me to climb that fence, me and my family are just gonna starve."" Fuck that.

"It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet.  
  
I've always found them annoying, say you're reading or studying at a cafe and they roar by louder than an invading Mongolian horde. God forbid they stop at a light since now you're stuck listening to that ungodly chortle for a good minute or so.  
  
I'm a single parent now and live by a fairly well travelled road. They wake my baby up consistently, and he has a hard time with his sleeping habits.  
  
It's a choice to make your vehicle that loud, not a necessity. On top of that, the rider or driver does not have to hear his most of his own racket since most of the sound is projected backwards.  
  
These people are assholes. I wish I could wake them up every 15 minutes with their own stupid vehicle.

I had no idea this post would get this big and, as much as I'd like to, I can't possibly hope to discuss this with all of you. Thank you to everyone, on both sides of the issue, for your reasoned and very interesting replies.  
  
The argument that got me closest to changing my view was surely that of safety. Other people are saying being loud is not as important for safety as actually driving well on a motorcycle, and this seems to be coming from cyclists as well, so unless I see some sort of peer reviewed study over anecdotal evidence that line of thinking isn't doing it for me.
  
My favorite arguments were those along the lines of ""It's a free country, you're the one that's being inconsiderate by expecting the riders to be silent."" The image of some tatted up Hell's Angel roaring through town and impinging on the hearing of 500 people and then screaming ""IM BEING OPPRESSED"" when someone suggests he tones down the throttle is simply delicious.  A special thank you to everyone who called me a pussy via PM. It's good to know you care so much.
  
I also learned that the sound that irritates so many of us so well is the sound of straight pipe exhausts. Cheers all!

Just a caveat here, there's a few comments in this thread that highlight the problem with some drivers very well. I'm not gonna call anyone out by name but the gist is that I'm annoyed over a minor inconvenience and I should get over it, people like driving loud cars and they're gonna keep doing it.   
  
I don't think any new parent would call it a minor inconvenience after spending 30 minutes putting a baby to sleep only to be woken up 5 minutes into his nap by a purposely loud vehicle. **But this post isn't JUST about me, or my baby.** These drivers drive past countless people. People who are gravely ill. People who own dogs that will shit on the carpet because they're scared of the sound. Nursing homes. Someone with a migraine headache. People who work the night shift. And all these little acts, each one is a little fuck you from the driver. And all these little fuck yous add up to one huge mega fuck you to your community. **People with empathy get mad at this not just because it inconveniences them but because they know it inconveniences many others as well and the act is seen as grossly disrespectful because of that.**  
  
One PM I got said:  
  
&gt;I drive a loud car. Why? Because I like it.  
  
He doesn't take the time to think, ""How will my actions affect those around me? Is there any chance the thing I am about to do will harm someone, and, if that is the case, should I still do the thing?"" No, this person doesn't give a shit. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the very essence of being inconsiderate. ^and^an^asshole
 ","OP, while there are certainly assholes out there, many with loud vehicles are not. If you and your community feel that they are problems, lobby your local government to legally lower the appropriate noise ordinance and have the police solve the problem. If your community doesn't agree with you, sadly your options are restricted to moving or insulating your home to the level where outside noise does not bother you.

Personally, I drive a loud car (for performance reasons) which I have used to increase my technical skills. I have taken precautions so that my car isn't as loud as it could be (resonators and a muffler), but it can still be loud. Because of this, I am very careful when driving through residential areas and ensure that I drive in a higher gear to limit the noise I make (lower revs = less noise). I live near an area with strict noise ordinances and have never had a problem because I am considerate of others. 

Basically, my point is that I (and others in this thread) am proof that not all operators of loud vehicles are inconsiderate assholes. There certainly are inconsiderate assholes, but a blanket labeling of all those who operate loud vehicles is using the same logic that a racist uses to justify their bigotry. Blanket generalizations are generally fallacious because there is almost always someone who doesn't fit into those generalizations. In this regard, I believe your CMV should be changed to say that people who purposefully aim to disrupt the lives of others by being unnecessarily loud are inconsiderate assholes, because that's taking into account the people who aren't inconsiderate assholes.","I own 3 cars with no catalytic converters and a high flow muffler and one car has no mufflers or anything.

I don't do this because I'm an inconsiderate asshole, I do it because I like it, and most people modify their cars for their liking. I always drive down my own street at a low rpm because I am considerate of my neighbors. If you live near a busy street you have to live with the noise. People who modify their cars to be loud don't know that you have a baby that's trying to sleep when you're living next to a busy street. You can't expect people to be considerate of you just because you chose to have a kid and live where you do. ",399,"OP, while there are certainly assholes out there, many with loud vehicles are not.

"With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned in that way everything seemed to go more or less fine (of course there were others interspersed but that was the majority of viewpoints). As more and more groups began to be introduced there were shall we say competing interests. They correctly are asking for space within the community as well. However, the problem is White men had already kind of adopted this space as a place where they could discuss their problems without feeling guilty etc. For example, when people complain about false rape charges getting to the front page constantly or reverse discrimination cases etc etc. I think the SJW this and that we often see is just pushback from White Men feeling ""invaded"" for lack of a better word. I'm not saying this is right. I think this last ush of banning subs etc also has the same implications first FatPeopleHate is seen as appealing to women and feminists. Then Coontown seen as appealing to minorities. I think its reflective of White Men feeling like all other people get to have their spaces etc. but they never do. What I got from the threads is that people feel betrayed and I believe that feeling is genuine. 

So here's the actual CMV. Why can't everyone just let White Guys have this one. Why can't we all just either accept that this is and will be a site that leans towards issues important to (straight) White Men and will be biased towards their opinions or leave and go to a different site. Its not like their aren't other hubs. And I'm not saying that there shouldn't be differences of opinion etc. (newsflash: not all White guys think the same). But just as anyone is welcome to watch Logo and comment on it etc no one would complain that the content is too gay or be upset if anti-gay things or things that appear to be anti-gay get the equivalent of downvoted (and no I'm not comparing experiences in any way). I also think that if people recognized this gping in there would be less abrasive push back from the trolls and ""dark side"" of reddit.


Edit: reply from /r/nannyhap produced new idea that perhaps having a place that tolerates hateful views makes for an artificial influx of them. Doesn't quite change my view all the way but definitely something I hadn't considered.

"**Massive spoilers below.**

I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking him dead.

Watney is not dead though, and has to survive on Mars via his wits alone til he can make some contact with Earth (his crewmates having taken all but one radio, and the one they didn't take having stabbed him before flying off.

In the book.  Watney establishes contact with NASA by driving over to the Sojurner rover and stealing/fixing it to transmit to Earth (which...*awesome*).

A few plans are developed to save him, one involving a hastily built probe to resupply him which blows up on takeoff.  That first one I buy.  But the latter plans I don't.  And I have two principal objections.

First, it seems like NASA executives make the calls on these.  This would not be the case.  It would be the President of the United States making the ultimate decision to greenlight projects.  And at that level, it seems very unlikely that they'd get the greenlight.  The independence of NASA in the book is greatly at odds with how I see government agencies working.

The Chinese government would not give a large booster over to NASA like they did.  This is portrayed as happening at the agency level coordinating with the Chinese space agency and then presenting it to political leaders as a fait accompli.

The plan is super-risky though, and depends on a single resupply mission with a quickly built supply ship - one of which just blew up on the pad.  If the resupply doesn't work, all 6 astronauts die.  Or 5, if they do space cannibalism.

I just don't think the governments of two countries who don't get along great would coordinate to waste hundreds of millions to billions of dollars (the plan also scrubs Ares 4 by taking its ascent vehicle), all to have a very low chance of rescuing one guy at the substantial risk to 5 more people.  And the Hermes mutiny to force the government's hand just seems absurdly implausible to me.

Much more likely is that Watney would have been asked to compose letters to whomever he wanted, perform science til his food ran out (assuming he was willing) and then take a lethal dose of morphine.

"Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out.  
  
Vietnam was essentially a communist state, due to influences from China and USSR, which were alliances (the former is debatable) of Vietnam during the war. After the war, our country has suffered multiple economic depressions, and famines due to the incompetence of our liberally named Communist Party. Granted the South Vietnam government wasn't any better, but what the U.S wanted for Vietnam was for the best.  
  
I understand that, technically the US did not wage war with our people, but stood against the spread of communism in Asia, and with our strategic location, a battle surely followed. The US did not deliberately invaded our country. And look at what they did to the world. ~~Defeated the Nazis and fascist countries~~, uplifted South Korea, Japan (which were both smaller and less resourceful than my country) to their respectable position on the world map today. And what had the sole communist party in my country done? Nothing but left our people in the struggle of a third-world country. And China is still brazenly harassing our borders and seas to this very day, just because our army is incapable of standing up for themselves.  
  
~~Please tell me if I was wrong and why the North won was a good idea.~~  
  
Edit: My view has changed. It was not simple as I thought it was. Generally it can be summarized into those points: involvement of China, motives and war crimes committed by the US, and there was no hope in the governing system. Communism has not helped our people a bit, but no one can really advocates for America either. We as a nation should look to develop our own path. Insights are still very much appreciated. And thanks for the discussions.","I think there's a fundamental problem with your premise. If you look at HOW the war started, you will see more issues with US involvement. The US acted as an aggressor.

They transformed a struggle that was essentially anti-colonialist (which they should have supported, based on their propaganda about freedom and shit), into a war-of-the-worlds-anti-communist struggle. They supported a corrupt government in the South (just like in Korea before the war there), which had no legitimacy, no credit, and no real power. Why do you think the Viet Cong was so successful? Poor people hated that government. (Just like in Korea, by the way...)

They also lied about an incident to get involved in the actual war (Gulf of Tonkin), and then they proceeded to massacre between 2 to 4 million of your countryfellows, bombed Laos and Cambodia, and enabled the Khmer Rouge to commit their own atrocities.

Had the US not interfered in the original struggle against the French, there would probably not have been Chinese/Russian involvement in the same extent. The Domino Theory was a paranoid delusion, and it caused immense suffering to your country.

As for which overlords are better? Look at Latin America, if you want to see what life under US influence is. (Well, was.) Look at Nicaragua, Columbia, El Salvador, Chile, etc... not nice places to live (and die, unless you like being thrown out of airplanes, or killed for demanding 10cent more for the hourly wage of banana pickers). The Commies were not much better, either (I grew up in Central Europe on the other side of the Iron Curtain), but they at least took some social issues seriously, and invested in education, healthcare and other stuff, which were somewhat beneficial, even if it was stupid at times, like pushing for heavy industry in agricultural countries. (Just look how Afghanistan looked like in the 70s...)

The US involvement was wrong both morally and legally. From there it makes no difference what the outcome would have been; but if you really want to think about it, you might want to look at South Korea on the bright side, or the Philippines, Latin America on the dark side.

Within a span of 30 years the French were expelled, the United States was stopped from partitioning or exerting control over the country, and shortly thereafter a Chinese invasion was repelled.

"The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg).

&gt;Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.

I've seen people use this quote many times. To me, it's inflammatory anti-religious nonsense. I'm interested to see the other perspective. Have I misunderstood his quote? Is there something about human nature that I've misunderstood?

First of all, I recognize that religion can cause good people to do bad things. It has done it many times and it will continue to do so. ISIS is the most obvious example right now, but there are countless other examples as well.

What I can't understand is the last sentence:

&gt;But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.

He seems to be saying that **only religion** can cause good people to do bad things. This seems like total nonsense to me. TONS of things can cause good people to do bad things.

For example, soldiers who commit war crimes sometimes do so because they were ""just following orders,"" out of a sense of patriotism, or in order to protect their families.

Poverty can make good people do evil things. 

Drugs can, too. They can temporarily taking away people's sanity, which causes them to do stupid things. Or drug addictions can drive people to such financial desperation that they're willing to do evil things to get their next hit.

---

Let me explain what I understand by ""good people"" and ""evil things."" Perhaps I haven't properly understood what Weinberg meant by these words?

A ""good person"" is someone who wouldn't normally do an evil thing without the influence of some outside force. In the case of this quote, the ""outside force"" is religion.

An ""evil thing"" is anything that society generally sees as extremely bad, such as murder. 

In order to CMV, please:

* convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things.
* show me that I could've misunderstood Weinberg.
* show me that my definitions of ""good person"" or ""evil thing"" are wrong (in the context of Weinberg's quote, of course).
* anything else that shows that anything I've said is wrong.

This quote could be held as true only under the premise that ""religion"" in this case does not refer exclusively to theistic religions. Any system of rituals or beliefs that people follow, including the patriotic following of orders you referred to, is a religion in this context.

That depends. When do you define a person by their actions whether they're good and when do you define them by their ideology?

Indoctrination happens in mostly religious households and scenarios. Yes, political as well, but when it comes to beliefs and values I think religion does the indoctrination part a bit more. Especially with the whole ""hell if you don't believe"" idea.

I think that someone isn't a good person if they have an ideology I disagree with. I think nationalists are bad, fascists are bad and so on. So when it comes to ideology, they're not good people doing bad things, they're bad people doing bad things.

""Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.""

He's certainly right when saying with or without religion, good people would do good things and bad people would do evil things.

Some actions aren't evil, yet aren't good either. So maybe good people could do bad things yet not evil.

Theft is an obvious example. It's not a good thing surely, and good people could do this whether or not they were religious, for different reasons. But it's hardly *evil*. Sometimes, theft is necessary or them to survive.

"I have recently been told that my pro-life position is ""forcing my ideas on others"".  I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary.  This "" forcing ideals on others"" is an argument I hear often and I just want to understand it better. I believe that a fetus is a human being. I confess, that is my view, not everyone's view. I believe an abortion is the murder of that child. This is still my view. Not everyone's. United States law entitles all humans to life. Passing legislation opposing abortion is simply following that idea in my way. I am not forcing anyone to agree with me. I am simply making sure the law is followed as I read it. 

For a hypothetical:

It's 1870 and there is a white who believes that black people are subhuman (not so uncommon at the time). If I say no they are not subhuman. They are human beings and I will prosecute you if you kill them am I "" forcing my ideals on them"" or am I simply protecting what I believe to be human life. And even if I am ""forcing my ideals"" on the man isn't it necessary to do so?  

The abortion debate is a matter of whether the fetus is indeed entitled to the rights of a living human. It has nothing to do with a group forcing it's ideas on another and such statements are only used to unjustly vilify the pro-life movement.","You've asked this a few times: ""would you agree that ""forcing your ideas on others"" is not a fair attack on pro-life legislation?""

No, I don't agree. It's absolutely a fair attack, because of the word ""ideas"" (or alternatively, ""beliefs"").

In our society and in common language, the word ""idea"" or ""belief"" is not applied to a concept that is - for all intents and purposes - universally agreed upon. Most people would not say the phrase ""murder is wrong"" is an ""idea"" or a ""belief"". Because basically everyone (except murderers) agrees on that, we talk about it as more of an objective **fact**. An underlying assumption we all have, that we then use for further discussion.

Please note that this doesn't mean something IS objective fact simply because everyone, or almost everyone, agrees. I'm just saying that's how we as a society tend to treat these topics.

On the other hand, when there is significant disagreement on a subject, the viewpoints of one side (or one person) IS generally referred to as an ""idea"" or ""belief"". So when people say pro-lifers are trying to force their ideas on everyone else, that's a fair statement. 

The converse isn't really true, either. You couldn't say that pro-choice people are ""forcing their beliefs"" because by definition, that side is advocating for choice. They are not saying you CAN'T do something, or saying you MUST do something. They are simply saying that the choice should exist. Offering someone that choice might offend you, but you are nonetheless not being forced to do anything.



","The fetus is, until birth, a parasite. This is true even if we all agree that it is a person.

"This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in.  I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained.  

My wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country.  I will reflect on my mother’s story.  She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country.  When she came to this country she was on government assistance.  With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master’s Degree.  Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community.  I don’t need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent’s generation, their hard work and sacrifice.  

I hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country.  I’ve read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings.  However I don’t completely buy into it.  I’ve seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education.  As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I’ll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do.   At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint.  As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings.  They had no problems acting 'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america.  That is why I don’t have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty.  I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story.  If there are books or articles which provides a cogent counter argument please feel free to share.    

TL:DR – The rationale for why blacks and Hispanics are unsuccessful in the U.S. are bunk because of the success of Asian Immigrants.  

Edit: This is not to say that there isn't racism in society, especially towards Asians.  Colleges definitely try to make it harder for Asians to get admitted despite higher scores, and there is a Bamboo Ceiling in the workplace.  However, I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.  

Edit2: I appreciate the dialogue.  One point which I'll concede and am swayed from the dialogue is that racism, more specifically the historic racism perpetrated in the U.S. such as Jim Crow and Slavery created the culture which is present in the poor black community, hindering them from rising from poverty.  But nothing disputes that this culture is reason, and not the present-day racism that is preventing them from achieving in this country.  That is what I have issue against that the media portrays a image of victimization due to current day racism, however, I don't think the type of racism is the cause, maybe past racism, but not the type minorities face today.  If no one has a counter argument against the cultural aspect, shouldn't black culture, the one that glamorizes the baller lifestyle, be the focused of policy makers to change rather than focusing their efforts on social restructuring to accomodate the culture?  

Edit3: At the end of the day, and the dialogue set forth I come away from it with the following:

1) That current poor black culture  is a result of systemic discrimination.  
2) No one has disputed that culture which I have generally claimed is the REASON for the state of poor black americans.  
3) The present day racism and white privilege that exists today is not sufficient enough to either hold a demographic down or lift them up, not as much as the modern day media seem to claim.   
4) I want to beef up on some books and articles cited
5) The IQ debate. hmmm I'm just not going to touch that right now.  
","Your knowledge of the systematic racism in this country is elementary at best. Maybe after a few more years living here and understanding the nuance you will have a better grasp of it. 


And since you asked for books. Start with James Baldwin and when you're done with his work, specifically The Fire Next Time,  I would recommend Ta-Nehisi Coates newest book.

In part the effects of that and the slavery thing is still ingrained in their culture. 

For the Latino population, many are illegal immigrants, which really affects their earning potential. Then their families also tend to be bigger too which means more money needed to support. Teen pregnancy rates were also higher for them which hinders them too.

"The goods and services we consume are made possible by the abundance of cheap resources and labour that the west gets out of underdeveloped countries. The West has no reason to aid or allow the development of these poorer countries, since that would disrupt the ability to acquire cheap resources, thus diminishing the economic superiority of the west. All in all, people in the west's lives can only be ""good"" because people's lives in poor nations are ""bad"". With the current infrastructure on earth, it is only possible to make the west happy, not everyone. ","I had a really long counterargument, but I lost it all.  So I'll spare you and give you the short version.

It's kind of counter-intuitive to view things like the low cost of exported resources or the low cost of wages as being exploitative of developing countries.  Those are economic advantages for those countries and allow them to compete globally, even when they may have poor infrastructure, dysfunctional governments, etc.  And, ideally, they disappear slowly as a country develops, giving it time to adjust and plan for the future as it's economic situation changes.  

It's also important to understand that low wages don't mean cheap manufacturing.  Currency exchange really comes into play here.  China is a good example.  For a few years a while back, it was artificially deflating its currency to make it more attractive to offshoring.  The stronger the renminbi was relative to the dollar, the less cost effective it was to move manufacturing there.  After they ended that practice, you saw companies like Motorola even move manufacturing back to the US, because high tech, low labor factories in the US were nearly as cost effective as low tech, labor intensive factories in China.  The Moto X was reported to have cost only an additional $4 a unit to be manufactured in the US.

On the flip side, rising costs from developing nations does not make Western lifestyles unsustainable.  As those countries get wealthier, their middle class grows.  A growing middle class means more people who buy Western goods. Have you ever wondered why GM kept Buick around after it's bankruptcy?  It sits awkwardly between Chevrolet and Cadillac.  A fully optioned Chevy will often cost as much as a comparable but less featured Buick and a fully optioned Buick starts getting close to Cadillac pricing territory.  Buick is incredibly popular in China.  GM will slap a Buick badge on a crappy, cheap car from Korea and it will outsell anything they offer in the US.  So margins may get thinner, because resources and manufacturing get more expensive, but overall revenue increases because the market grows larger.  

That's not to say that it would be sustainable for *every* country to be on the same economic level as the US.  I don't know how well that would work.  But a Western lifestyle would not be harmed much by bringing the world up to, say, the middle class standards of China.","Countries go through a development life cycle. Initially, they are under-developed and poor, with low wages. However, those low wages are a competitive advantage, as goods can be produced cheaply there. So multinational companies move their factories there. That abundance of new jobs, even if they're poorly paying from an international frame of reference, are better paying that what the people use to do. Then secondary industries pop up. Restaurants that cater to the factory works, for example. Some of those restaurants succeed, some fail. Those who own the ones that succeed, make money. Also, people who succeed in the factory become managers. They send their kids to get better a education than they received, and thus they get a better skill set. That better skill set from a more educated populace leads to more skilled labor. More skilled labor leads to better paying jobs, as now companies that require skilled labor will look to the country, because even skilled labor will be cheaper there then elsewhere. Eventually, skilled labor becomes the comparitive advantage for the country, and some other underdeveloped country becomes the low skill, low wage location.

This is how the world works man. It's what's happening in China, as suddenly Chinese wages are higher than say, Vietnamese wages. This keeps on happen as countries develop.

Technology plays a major role in how quickly this happens. It's also about to flip the whole thing on it's head, as automation starts to reach new heights. Soon, labor won't be anywhere close to the requirement it once was to create finished goods, and capital investment (into machines) will become much, much more important.

"I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that information triggers victims, and therefore the information ends up at ends. This includes language such as ""Pepper spray can deter attackers of any kind, and therefore it is strongly recommended that ANYBODY carries it with them at all times."" or ""Hot zones for crime include times after dusk and before dawn, so it is advised to travel in groups at this time to deter attackers.""

People rage at this information saying that I should not ask anything of the victim, and that this information is useless. People often use the argument ""We should teach people NOT TO RAPE""

My issue here is that the suppression of this information in lieu of pursuing an idealistic rape-free culture neglects the current standing of our surroundings, and that dangerous people still exist, and will exist for the foreseeable future. I see no harm in telling anyone that safety is important, and that there are very cogent steps to significantly lower your risk of being attacked and/or raped.

The only instance I would excuse my previous statement would be people telling actual victims of rape what they COULD have done. This does nothing to change what happened, and is a slimey thing to do.

Maybe this is just an Anti-SJW rant that I didn't even know I was making, or maybe I have an actual argument here. If I am not clear on this classic argument, I would appreciate some clarity, and am always open to thoughtful and courteous discussion.

In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want to is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to things that are unacceptable to do to a person without his or her permission. Telling someone that they can't get a medical procedure done (or, likewise, telling that they HAVE to get a medical procedure done) is just as awful as is dictating how they were their hair or how they dress. In that same vein, what makes it okay in our society for your significant other to dictate who you sleep with? 

Sex in our society is a recreational activity enjoyed by most adults in at least some capacity. People dictating what their SOs do for fun in their free time seems rather controlling. Adults should feel free to do what their bodies what they wish as long as they aren't physically forcing another person to do something. Forcing another person to only have sex with you seems to me like an awfully controlling behavior and takes away the body autonomy that they should have. 

I can understand if a couple decides between the two of them that would like to sleep exclusively with each other. It's just surprising to me at times that it is the norm to be mad enough at your SO to break up with them if they have sex with someone outside of the relationship. I understand that people cheat all the time, but open relationships just seem to be the exception rather than the norm. 

If you want a monogamous relationship and your SO sleeps with someone else, then you shouldn't be mad at your SO. You should simply realize that you guys want different things out of a relationship and part ways. Getting angry would be controlling your SO and taking away his or her own control over his or her own body. 

And just for clarification: I am not saying that everyone should go out and cheat on their SOs. I am more stating that it *should* be normal and acceptable for people to have sex with people outside of a two person relationship for no other reason than that it is oddly controlling to insist that your SO sleep with no one besides you. 

Also, I wanted to point out that I am purposefully not using particular genders. It is just as bad to for a woman to tell a man he can't have sex outside the relationship as it would be if a man told a woman the same thing. 

So, please. Change my view! Why should it be the norm to have monogamous relationships?

"I've never understood the vehemence of popular opinion against the hydrogen airship. People balk at the idea of flying around in something filled with explosive gas, yet it seems to me that airliners, when they go wrong, are often just as (or more) fatal to their occupants. The Hindeburg disaster only killed just over a third of the people on board; the majority of airliner crashes kill everyone on board. Overall, the death toll of conventional airplanes, though small, has vastly exceeded that of airships, yet it is airships that retain the reputation of being death-traps. 

The truth is, airships were an idea that was completely out of step with its times; during the period where they were most economically viable, materials and engine technology, among many other things, were barely adequate to deal with their demands. An airship built to Zeppelin scales with modern materials technology and design techniques would be dramatically stronger, lighter, faster and safer, with aramid fibre skins stretched over composite frames. They would have satellite navigation and meteorology, and onboard weather radar to avoid dangerous weather; computerised systems would monitor hydrogen pressure and static build-ups, modern escape and fire suppression systems would provide a final back-up. Moreover, there is the potential to use solar power and electric motors to run these flying behemoths essentially for free, making them far more economically viable, both for passengers who don't mind a slower, more stately trip and for container cargo. You might even be able to use onboard generated power to crack water to produce hydrogen to replenish losses, though I'm not sure how feasible that would be.

Also, it's very hard to deny that airships are really fucking cool.

"Just a while ago there was a post on /r/athiesm I think?  About graphs that showed similar heat signatures on a US map of where the bible belt was and another map of something negative that was pronounced in the same area.  The argument being that being religious was a cause of this other negative attribute.  While I do agree that those maps aren't ""necessarily"" related, they *could* be, and one of the top comments being the famous ""Correlation does not equal causation"" was posted to refute it.

Okay I decided to stop being lazy and [found it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/3a5yid/these_3_maps_seems_to_be_similar/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)

In my opinion, this is a popular cop-out reasoning that is posted and highly valued on reddit as truth, and it needs to be re-vamped to say ""Correlation does not necessarily equal causation.""

My argument is simple and is portrayed through an example: My workers have been moving slower and are less productive recently, and I post a notice on the bulletin board that someone will be fired by the end of the month if productivity isn't increased.  I look at the end of the month and productivity *has* greatly increased .  Now, it is technically true that it could be possible that me threatening them to speed up wasn't the causation to them actually speeding up, even though it was correlated, but lets be realistic. It is only in these simple scenario's that the blurred line is a lot more simple, and in ones like the reddit post above, the information given is far more complicated.  But just because the information is more complicated, doesn't mean that we should imply there isn't a possibility of the causation *actually* being correlated by making the bold statement ""Correlation does not equal causation"" as opposed to ""Correlation does not necessarily equal causation.""

Honestly,  I think there's just a misunderstanding here. ""Revamping"" the phrase is both technically unnecessary and won't help with confusion.

It's technically unnecessary because as phrased, the statement *is* true. Correlation and causation are different ideas. It's not even a rectangle/square kind of relationship. Correlation is *evidence* for or against causation, but it never makes sense to say that a Correlation *is a* causation. It's a category error even when the causal relationship *exists*.

Second, your clarification doesn't get to the heart of the misunderstandings. Everyone already knows the essence of what you're trying to more clearly imply. No one thinks that correlation is somehow evidence *against* causation.

That said, the phrase is certainly often used as a copout. If you're trying to argue for causation,  correlations on their own are insufficient. To make a really compelling case, you need to hypothesize a mechanism by which the causation takes place, and that hypothesis will yield addition tests to run. If you're arguing against causation,  you're right that Correlation does not equal causation,  but if someone presents a compelling Correlation that you have no explanation for, you're argument is going to look pretty weak. But none of this implies a fundamental problem with the phrase itself.

"I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand perfectly where this will get me, but I am simply not willing to throw all my time and energy into things I see as unnecessary. 

Don't get me wrong I'm not some party high schooler, quite the opposite really. I am an all honors student with many AP classes that I have been scheduled to take next year after taking one AP class this year (sophomore year). I don't waste my time with things I see as trivial and slowly school has turned into something I see as trivial. Instead of doing my school work I spend timing learning how to program or watching a documentary on issues in this world. I write, I read, and I just try to learn everything I can but just not at school. I feel like I need the freedom to choose what I do and when I do it and I am just not allowed this with school.

Every morning I wake up at 6:45 sit through painstakingly boring classes with rare highlights as there is just one or two classes I can somewhat enjoy. If there's a test it's a 50/50 that I'll turn it in half blank and if it's a lecture or some other activity I'll tune in only once awhile to get the gist of the lesson. I sometimes look around to my peers and see people with 4.0+ gpa's who are completely focused on school. I see them during free periods doing all the work assigned and I see them get mad when they get 2 points taken off. When I see this I can appreciate the effort, but at the end of the day there are literally thousands of other people just like them. Every school in the country has a couple valedictorians who will all be competing to get into the ""best"" colleges and a majority of them will not make it.

I think I understand the importance of college and I feel like I would excel at some of the top university, but as of now I not chasing that 4.0+ gpa required to get there and I don't see myself doing that anytime soon. I love to learn, I really love to learn and I teach myself new things I find interesting and useful everyday. That passion continues grow but it's pushing me away from going to the best colleges which I have been told will allow me to achieve the things I want to do. So please tell me why I should need to get that 4.0+ gpa and go to the best of the best of colleges. I want to help the world, but I'm not sure I'm going about it in the right way.

Edit: Thanks for all the advice guys. It's been very helpful and I'll be visiting this thread in the future when my determination will inevitably falter.

"I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say.  Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I look forward to hearing another point of view.

My main points:

1.) Physically.  Men dominate sports and physical events.  I can't think of one sport that women are better than men at, in general, and if there are a few, that's only a few, and men dominate the rest. 

2.) In the work place.  This is the most controversial part.  Women want equal pay, but from what I've seen in my limited 8 years in industry, is that women are not as good as men at their jobs.  My industry is oil refining.  99% of the plant workers are men, why?  I work in the Engineering office.  There are no women engineers, only secretaries, and some of them baffle me at how incompetent they are. (Admittedly our one secretary is excellent at her job, and does far better than I ever could.  But my point here is that a man could do that job just as well.) 

3.) At home.  This is where most of my point lies.  It could just be a gender roles thing, but why am I so much better at everything than my girlfriend?  I'm not saying I'm great, but rather most of the girlfriends I've had are completely incompetent at a lot of things.  Things like building an Ikea cabinet, she can't do it.  Small, mundane challenges like un-stacking and re-stacking a sleeve of solo cups.  We had to do it as part of a challenge, and I was much faster at it.  She couldn't figure out how the gear shifters worked on a newer mountain bike after riding it for 10 minutes.  I had never seen this type before, but figured it out in 10 seconds.  Not because I'm clever, but because it is simple and something I believe should be easy for any adult to figure out. 

These reasons are why I hold this view.  I look forward to being completely flamed for this view, and also for another perspective.  Thanks.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","OK. I'm going to look specifically at your points in turn.

1) **Physical**. Absolutely, men at their peak are stronger and faster than women. But a woman at her peak can be stronger or faster than the vast majority of men; look at [Katrin Tanja Davidsdottir](http://espn.go.com/espnw/athletes-life/article/13337513/katrin-tanja-davidsdottir-plays-mental-game-win-crossfit-games), I'm fairly certain she could take most men on and win. To further expand on your point; so what? So women are on average less strong. I'm not convinced that in the modern developed world this is a huge issue.

2) **Industry**. I really think your experiences have biased you here. [Oil refining is 18% female](http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm) (actually higher than I expected). This means that there will be default be a higher chance that the 'shining stars' will be male. Some of the issues you've seen are down to culture; we have only recently started to accept women in formerly 'male' lines of work such as engineering, so a lot of women who could perhaps have made excellent engineers would never have thought of it as a career option. As for the women who aren't good at their work- I wonder, do you notice the men who aren't good at their work too?

3) **At home**. This one's awkward. There are a few different possibilities here and, I'll be honest, none of my suggestions make you look good- I hope you don't get too offended. 

* First, I noticed that the issues you mentioned were all practical. You're an engineer- that's your bag. So you notice when your girlfriend isn't good at physical things. But I wonder if you've noticed your own failings? Perhaps she's always silently annoyed that you put your foot in it at social gatherings. Maybe you're not very good at art or design. Are these problems, are you possibly less good at them than she is? **Possibly, yes**.  But this is not something for which you should be blamed. They aren't part of your skill-set, but you can learn.

So what does this mean? my TL;DR is that I think you're focussing on things at which you are good, measuring some women against these, then using this to judge women as a whole.

Because you used your girlfriend(s) as an example, I will use mine current girlfriend to answer all of these points.

2)In the work place, my girlfriend whoops my ass in this category.  We are actually both engineering students and her GPA is better than mine (and mine is pretty good).  She also is a better and harder worker than me.

3)At home, I would say I am most likely better than my girlfriend.  I am incredible at caring for children and while I am not sure if she how good she is at something like this, I can assure I am better.  She is generally a better cook than me but I am better than her at things like cooking and cleaning.

All in all, we are pretty split in terms of things we each are better at and these traits span across various categories.  I have an extreme amount of respect for her which is maybe why I am willing to admit some of the things she is better at.

Sidenote: My ex girlfriend before her was not as good of an employee, not as intelligent, not as athletic, and not as good at any home tasks as me.  I was better than her in pretty much every sense of the word.

But like I initially said, I think it all comes down to exposure.",412,"OK. I'm going to look specifically at your points in turn.

1) **Physical**. Absolutely, men at their peak are stronger and faster than women. But a woman at her peak can be stronger or faster than the vast majority of men; look at [Katrin Tanja Davidsdottir](http://espn.go.com/espnw/athletes-life/article/13337513/katrin-tanja-davidsdottir-plays-mental-game-win-crossfit-games), I'm fairly certain she could take most men on and win. To further expand on your point; so what? So women are on average less strong. I'm not convinced that in the modern developed world this is a huge issue.

2) **Industry**. I really think your experiences have biased you here. [Oil refining is 18% female](http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm) (actually higher than I expected). This means that there will be default be a higher chance that the 'shining stars' will be male. Some of the issues you've seen are down to culture; we have only recently started to accept women in formerly 'male' lines of work such as engineering, so a lot of women who could perhaps have made excellent engineers would never have thought of it as a career option. As for the women who aren't good at their work- I wonder, do you notice the men who aren't good at their work too?

3) **At home**. This one's awkward. There are a few different possibilities here and, I'll be honest, none of my suggestions make you look good- I hope you don't get too offended. 

* First, I noticed that the issues you mentioned were all practical. You're an engineer- that's your bag. So you notice when your girlfriend isn't good at physical things. But I wonder if you've noticed your own failings? Perhaps she's always silently annoyed that you put your foot in it at social gatherings. Maybe you're not very good at art or design. Are these problems, are you possibly less good at them than she is? **Possibly, yes**.  But this is not something for which you should be blamed. They aren't part of your skill-set, but you can learn.

* Perhaps you're impatient. When you were looking at the gear system you used your previous knowledge and applied it to the situation at hand. There's no parallel for your girlfriend; it's the same as asking someone who's only ever driven an automatic car to move to a manual.

"Hello everyone, with all the media coverage lately regrading transgender individuals I find myself uneducated on the particular subject and would love to be enlightened on the topic. I support the rights and henceforth of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals but can't wrap my head around the idea of transgenderism. From a purely medical/biological standpoint, it doesn't seem as if one should be able to claim to be the opposite gender when scientifically they have been classified to be the other. Even with the surgeries and artificial hormone replacements, wouldn't the artificial nature of these changes render the claim illegitimate? From a societal standpoint, obviously the idea of gender identity is one that has, for a majority of human history, been based around a singular core fact - we have two genders, man and woman, and you are either one or the other. Is there more to this perceived truth, or is transgenderism the result of a mental nuance that simply appears now because of the emergence of rights for the LGBT community, but has in fact, always been there?

This post isn't meant to attack/offend/etc. anyone, and again if I seem ignorant on the subject it is only because frankly I am and am only here to be educated. Thanks for any responses that can help me understand.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who's contributed (positively); I've learned a lot from this thread such as gender vs. sex, gender dysphoria, transgender vs. transsexual, etc. I definitely feel I have a better grasp of trans as a whole.

I highly recommend you research this more, but I'll try to touch on the basics.

Sex is rooted in an organism's DNA, and is defined by which reproductive cells (sperm or eggs) they produce. Animals with testes who produce sperm are biologically male, and animals with ovaries who produce eggs are considered female. You're probably familiar with X and Y chromosomes, which is how sex is determined in humans, right?

Actually, things go wrong. [Swyer Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_gonadal_dysgenesis) is a big example, in which a person has an XY chromosome but something goes wrong with the Y. Humans are actually female by default, and the Y chromosome is required to activate in order to form male parts. Without it, people with Swyer develop uteri, vaginae, and other normal female organs. However, they have streak gonads which don't produce sperm OR eggs. So what do you call them? Their chromosomes say male. Their organs say female. But they can't reproduce as either one. This is just one of many examples of conditions that show how sex is not even nearly as straightforward as it seems when everything goes normally.

So, this is only half the problem. Now we need to address gender. While there are several definitions of gender, some of which address biology, the accepted definition in most of the social sciences is the combination of external and internal social features that are associated with masculinity or femininity. These usually, but not often, correlate with sex. But for obvious reasons, people who lack an easily definable sex might also be hard to correctly gender. But, clearly, these people aren't genderless, they still have elements of masculinity and/or femininity. That leads us to the question: if gender can be rooted in something that isn't biology, isn't it always rooted in something else, at least partially?

The easy answer is a person's feelings. Hormones, body structures, socialization, and a thousand other things can feed into how we perceive our gender, leading to the inevitable conclusion that gender is determined primarily by how we act and how others act towards us.

Imagine, if you will, that you find out tomorrow you actually have two X chromosomes. I'm assuming you're male, or at least you think you are. But for all you know, your genitals are the product of elaborate surgery when you were an infant- you actually were born with a vagina and streak gonads, but your clitoris was large enough that doctors were able to turn it into a penis and give you testicular implants. I'll admit, it's far-fetched, but in the end it's very hard to know our sex for certain until we've conceived a child or had serious testing done. But let's assume it happens. Would you immediately ask for breast implants, get your facial hair permanently removed, and start dating men while considering yourself straight? Probably not, right? Your gender goes deeper than just what you understand your body to be.

Similarly, if you were abducted by aliens and had your sex switched against your will, do you think you would still identify with your prior gender?

Now, don't get me wrong. There's a heavy correlation between sex and gender for a reason, and part of that is biology. Testosterone does correlate with aggressive, masculine behavior. But there are plenty of aggressive women, right? And while pregnancy does cause mothers to form a tight chemical bond with their children, there are fathers out there who form just as close of an emotional connection without being pregnant. Our bodies might make it easier to act as our gender, might give us the right chemical cues and biological urges, but they do not define everything we feel.

Furthermore, gender isn't even so much about feelings as it is the way we act. Crossdressing proves this- a convincing crossdresser knows how to present themselves as the opposite gender, to the point where few people will ever guess their sex doesn't ""match up"". Have you ever wanted to wear a dress, just to see what it's like? Wished someone would bring you flowers or pick you up for prom or be the big spoon? Maybe you wanted to wear pink or high heels or makeup? You could even enjoy baking or childcare or color-organizing your sock drawer, for all I know. Ovaries don't make someone any more likely to enjoy the color pink than testicles do, these things are based in our personal preferences and how we were socialized as kids.

Being transgender means that your genitals don't match up with the gender that you relate most to. Most of us have some preferences and behaviors that don't line up with our gender, like tbulldykes. They are clearly able to have these masculine feelings, preferences, and behaviors while still identifying as a woman. However, is it so hard to believe that they could have a few more of those preferences, pushing them into predominantly masculine territory? People fall all over the spectrum; we do a lot of policing to tell children what they're ""supposed"" to do and like, but if you watch toddlers at play when they're still too young to have this solidly internalized, you'll see there are a good number of girls who run with the boys and boys who play house with the girls. Being transgender later in life is just like that on a more complex scale, having preferences that are mostly feminine when you have testes or masculine when you have ovaries.

Basically, our bodies don't define what we think, feel, and do. From a biological standpoint of sex, maybe we really can't change. But from a social and cultural point, it's not only possible, it's fairly easy.","&gt; Gender identity should be based upon the genitals with which you were born with and the hormones your body naturally produces.

Based on the standard meaning of these terms, this view is... almost ungrammatical?

Gender identity is (by definition) a person's sense of their own masculinity and/or femininity, and the degree to which they perceive themselves as a being more like a man/woman/both/neither.  Gender identity is entirely subjective, so  _should_ doesn't makes sense there in terms of a prescriptive statement.  Or, to put it another way, what anyone else thinks about whether a person is a man or a woman is is something _other_ than gender identity.

The word _should_ does make sense as a causal statement, in that ~99.9% of people have a gender identity and hormones that match the normal pattern.  (It's worth noting that the genitals a person is born with are determined almost entirely by hormones and related gene regulatory systems during embryonic development)

&gt; From a purely medical/biological standpoint, it doesn't seem as if one should be able to claim to be the opposite gender when scientifically they have been classified to be the other

Since the word _gender_ is used to refer to social and behavioral qualities, I'll assume you're really referring to _sex_ here.  Actually, the biological development of two different sexes in humans isn't as clear cut as you might think, as demonstrated by the existence of a plethora of different types of intersex categories.  For example, chromosomes don't always match up with hormones or external genitals.  There are people with XY chromosomes who are born with vulva/vagina, and there are people with XX chromosomes who are born with a penis.  Some people have XXY chromosomes, rather than XX or XY.  Due to the way human developmental biology works, these people are typically externally male.  

Sex is a set of biological characteristics that typically go together but don't always.  Quite a few of these biological characteristics can actually be (biologically) changed over time with hormones.  Skin, body hair, fat distribution, musculature, breasts... these are all things that change, biologically.  Once that change has taken place, the result is often very similar to siblings of the target sex.  Transgender men grow body and facial hair, build muscle more easily and in different places, their voices drop, they smell like cis men, get male-pattern baldness, etc...  The skin of transgender women softens and they grow breasts typically about a cup size smaller than cis-women siblings.  If the transition starts before something called   Once these changes take place, the scientific/biological classification of them as men or women becomes less clear.  Scientifically/biologically speaking, they become inter-sex.  Hormones change almost everything other than primary reproductive organs.

&gt; for a majority of human history, been based around a singular core fact - we have two genders, man and woman, and you are either one or the other. Is there more to this perceived truth, or is transgenderism the result of a mental nuance that simply appears now because of the emergence of rights for the LGBT community, but has in fact, always been there?

Several cultures have recognized trans- and/or third genders since more or less the dawn of recorded history.  Other commenters have probably mentioned the hijra and native-american two-spirit people as examples.

&gt; This post isn't meant to attack/offend/etc. anyone, and again if I seem ignorant on the subject it is only because frankly I am and am only here to be educated. Thanks for any responses that can help me understand.

Ultimately, trans-men cannot become cis-men, and trans-women cannot become cis-women.  If you wanted to classify them as accurately as possible, you'd have to say they were inter-sex by choice, but in many ways closer to the sex typically associated with their self-identified gender.  Since typical language use doesn't communicate all this information, it's best just to go with what (1) respects the person's self-identification and (2) is probably closer to anyway.

If you are interacting with a person who has a full beard, bald head, deep voice, strong upper-body muscles, and acts like a guy, don't you just default to using masculine pronouns and names rather than asking about their genitals first?  Yeah, the reality is more complicated, but referring to that person as a man is ""less wrong"" than referring to that person as a woman.  And constantly being more specific (1) emphasizes that person's difference, probably in a way that's very hurtful and (2) puts them in danger of potentially being discriminated against (or even violently attacked) for being queer.

TL;DR, transsexuals become scientifically/biologically intersex, and while the reality is somewhat more complicated, the transformation is sufficiently robust that it's ""less wrong"" to call trans-women women and trans-men men than vice-versa.

Actually, the biological development of two different sexes in humans isn't as clear cut as you might think, as demonstrated by the existence of a plethora of different types of intersex categories.  For example, chromosomes don't always match up with hormones or external genitals.  There are people with XY chromosomes who are born with vulva/vagina, and there are people with XX chromosomes who are born with a penis.  Some people have XXY chromosomes, rather than XX or XY.  Due to the way human developmental biology works, these people are typically externally male.  

Sex is a set of biological characteristics that typically go together but don't always.  Quite a few of these biological characteristics can actually be (biologically) changed over time with hormones.  Skin, body hair, fat distribution, musculature, breasts... these are all things that change, biologically.  Once that change has taken place, the result is often very similar to siblings of the target sex.  Transgender men grow body and facial hair, build muscle more easily and in different places, their voices drop, they smell like cis men, get male-pattern baldness, etc...  The skin of transgender women softens and they grow breasts typically about a cup size smaller than cis-women siblings.  If the transition starts before something called   Once these changes take place, the scientific/biological classification of them as men or women becomes less clear.  Scientifically/biologically speaking, they become inter-sex.  Hormones change almost everything other than primary reproductive organs.

&gt; for a majority of human history, been based around a singular core fact - we have two genders, man and woman, and you are either one or the other. Is there more to this perceived truth, or is transgenderism the result of a mental nuance that simply appears now because of the emergence of rights for the LGBT community, but has in fact, always been there?

Several cultures have recognized trans- and/or third genders since more or less the dawn of recorded history.  Other commenters have probably mentioned the hijra and native-american two-spirit people as examples.

&gt; This post isn't meant to attack/offend/etc. anyone, and again if I seem ignorant on the subject it is only because frankly I am and am only here to be educated. Thanks for any responses that can help me understand.

Ultimately, trans-men cannot become cis-men, and trans-women cannot become cis-women.  If you wanted to classify them as accurately as possible, you'd have to say they were inter-sex by choice, but in many ways closer to the sex typically associated with their self-identified gender.  Since typical language use doesn't communicate all this information, it's best just to go with what (1) respects the person's self-identification and (2) is probably closer to anyway.

If you are interacting with a person who has a full beard, bald head, deep voice, strong upper-body muscles, and acts like a guy, don't you just default to using masculine pronouns and names rather than asking about their genitals first?  Yeah, the reality is more complicated, but referring to that person as a man is ""less wrong"" than referring to that person as a woman.  And constantly being more specific (1) emphasizes that person's difference, probably in a way that's very hurtful and (2) puts them in danger of potentially being discriminated against (or even violently attacked) for being queer.

TL;DR, transsexuals become scientifically/biologically intersex, and while the reality is somewhat more complicated, the transformation is sufficiently robust that it's ""less wrong"" to call trans-women women and trans-men men than vice-versa.

"To pull an example of a single thread forum off the web: [here](http://support.zathyus.com/index/).

The only situation where single threads might be good is where a fixed group is involved, for example project planning by a small team or a roleplaying session with a game master.  In that case, it might be good to prevent the conversation from fracturing and keep everyone on the same page.

When it comes to most social or entertainment purposes, reddit's style of branching threads with up/downvotes just works better.

-It prevents the loudest people in the conversation from drowning everyone out.  In addition, it allows you to ignore particularly obnoxious posters.

-It allows discussion of a tangent without derailing the main topic.

-It allows you to go back to earlier posts in the conversation and address points that were overlooked the first time around.

-Upvotes give you a way to silently voice approval, without wasting words to repeat what the other poster said.

-Reddit's AMA tradition is one of the better ways of conducting public interviews, and it would not be possible in a single thread forum.

With all these advantages, I don't think that single thread forums should be used as much as they are.

However, that doesn't change the fact that the laws exist, and are the basis of my argument. For the people who do get uncomfortable around nude breasts, a single father with his adolescent daughter, or a mother with a teenage son, or even some old stick in the mud curmudgeon, I don't think it's too much to ask to handle such things in private. Whether pumping milk, or nursing at home, there are ways of handling these things. No one else is obligated to accommodate

"I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning.

That, and it feels rewarding knowing I gathered something(s) with immediate marketable value. That, and that, and the idea of all of the potential uses and benefits to having this information. 

I've been to a lot of hackathons (programming-marathons) and open-data is an awesome opportunity to make something cool and resume-building quickly (hackathons are usually only 24-48 hours overnight). The more data out there, the more possibilities there are to help the public or invent something novel.  

I think of the government the same way, if the data they collect and use helps their ability to govern then I am all for it.

-By agree to this, I take away other people's privacy rights, and that's not okay

The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons:

First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”. Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people’s inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. 

Second of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds. Examples for this are Venezuela or Columbia. 

All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc. However this are minor elements, which I think, should otherwise be implemented in fierce Capitalist society, where in order to succeed you cannot rely on gov. support, but 95 % on yourself.

Edit: I hope this is not too long of an explanation.

It's not supposed to be utopian. It's just ""we have a series of things in our economic system that are really fucked up in many ways, if we did this and that, we end up with a less fucked up system"".

&gt;In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed.

A basic knowledge of Marx tells you that the revolution required an informed industrial proletariat. The examples you give were full of illiterate peasants.

&gt;First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally.

Not how it works. Socialism and communism *mostly* care about the property of the *means of production*.

&gt;That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”.

It's not like Tsarist Russia was better. Also not like Russia with Putin has improved much. Many relevant metrics peaked during the late USSR. But yeah, it was obviously far from perfect.

Funny how you never hear the same ""it doesn't work because we're not perfect"" with capitalism, though.

&gt;All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc.

Those are mere concessions pried with sweat by the workers from the State that oppresses them.","&gt; Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism [...]

Socialism is by no means a precursor to anything, let alone communism. The notion of socialism preceding communism was a Marxist idea, probably propaganda, and is surely false considering the numerous countries that have successfully implemented democratic socialism, for instance: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Australia (formerly) and New Zealand (formerly). One could argue that the United States used to be a democratic socialist country following the New Deal reforms from 1933-38.

&gt; [...] are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich.

Again, be careful not to confuse the very broad concept of **socialism**, encompassing ideologies ranging from social democracy to revolutionary socialism, with **communism**, which broadly encompasses Trotskyism, Marxism-Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism, anarcho-communism and others.

&gt; However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist.

This is incredibly broad and vague, but if you're referring to the collapse of numerous *communist* power structures, then this is probably more often than not due to the undermining of left ideologies through American foreign policy, especially in regard to countries like Cuba. Cuba is also worth assessing since it is a third-world country and still has a higher life expectancy and a more efficient and accessible health-care system than the United States.

&gt; In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed.

Neither Russia nor China were socialist countries. It was their propaganda systems that declared themselves as socialist. For instance, nobody really believes that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is democratic.

&gt; First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally.

This is *not* socialism. At all. You really ought to research socialism as a political theory for yourself, since this sentence mirrors the sound bites heard from the Cato Institute and AEI.

It's not supposed to be utopian. It's just ""we have a series of things in our economic system that are really fucked up in many ways, if we did this and that, we end up with a less fucked up system"".

&gt;In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed.

A basic knowledge of Marx tells you that the revolution required an informed industrial proletariat. The examples you give were full of illiterate peasants.

&gt;First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally.

Not how it works. Socialism and communism *mostly* care about the property of the *means of production*.

&gt;That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”.

It's not like Tsarist Russia was better. Also not like Russia with Putin has improved much. Many relevant metrics peaked during the late USSR. But yeah, it was obviously far from perfect.

Funny how you never hear the same ""it doesn't work because we're not perfect"" with capitalism, though.

&gt;All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc.

Those are mere concessions pried with sweat by the workers from the State that oppresses them.","&gt; Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism [...]

Socialism is by no means a precursor to anything, let alone communism. The notion of socialism preceding communism was a Marxist idea, probably propaganda, and is surely false considering the numerous countries that have successfully implemented democratic socialism, for instance: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Australia (formerly) and New Zealand (formerly). One could argue that the United States used to be a democratic socialist country following the New Deal reforms from 1933-38.

&gt; [...] are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich.

Again, be careful not to confuse the very broad concept of **socialism**, encompassing ideologies ranging from social democracy to revolutionary socialism, with **communism**, which broadly encompasses Trotskyism, Marxism-Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism, anarcho-communism and others.

&gt; However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist.

This is incredibly broad and vague, but if you're referring to the collapse of numerous *communist* power structures, then this is probably more often than not due to the undermining of left ideologies through American foreign policy, especially in regard to countries like Cuba. Cuba is also worth assessing since it is a third-world country and still has a higher life expectancy and a more efficient and accessible health-care system than the United States.

&gt; In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed.

Neither Russia nor China were socialist countries. It was their propaganda systems that declared themselves as socialist. For instance, nobody really believes that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is democratic.

&gt; First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally.

This is *not* socialism. At all. You really ought to research socialism as a political theory for yourself, since this sentence mirrors the sound bites heard from the Cato Institute and AEI.

"I'm going to clarify that by 'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tag/disclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg discussions of suicide, rape, murder, etc.). The (exaggerated) culture surrounding TWs of the blanket avoidance of those topics and the overzealous labeling of 'offensive' content is not only something I do not support, but also not the topic of this CMV.

**EDIT: Maybe Trigger Warning wasn't the best phrase to use. I'm simply referring to the adding a disclaimer for content which depicts/describes material in such detail as to recall traumatic memories.**

TWs and Spoiler Alerts serve the same purpose of alerting the audience to content that they may not be willing to expose themselves at the time - be it a graphic depiction of a corpse or who died in the most recent episode of Game of Thrones (which could very well be the same image). While many support the latter, the former is reviled in some circles.

I think the argument for supporting the latter applies to the former: Just as you would like to avoid/be alerted to spoilers until you've gotten to that point in the story (you're 'narratively' prepared), it makes sense to alert others of content which may be emotionally distressing so that they can engage with it when they're emotionally prepared.

You could say that there's a presumption of eventual engagement with Spoiler Alerts, you wouldn't be worried about them if didn't plan on following the story. With TWs, someone could duck out of all triggering content forever. But that doesn't seem to be reason to denounce TWs as a whole: you're still saving that person and many others (who could be working to overcome those triggers) undue emotional distress.

You also could argue with my definition of emotionally distressing content, stating that it very easily leads to a slippery slope ending with everyone having to tag all of their content, but I'm not terribly persuaded by that argument. For one, regardless of a individual communities definitions of spoilers (we all know Snape killed Dumbledore by now, right?), endings and most recent episodes are universally considered spoilers. Similarly, I'm sure that sexual violence and gore can be considered universal triggers. Discovering how broad a community's definition of spoilers/triggers is done by engaging with that community. As for giving TWs being too much of an inconvenience, I think that's more of a matter of getting used to it: you extend that courtesy when discussing spoilers, why not for when you're discussing triggers?

"White girls very rarely date Asian men. Even in Asia white men are much more popular than Asian men. Even though an Asian guy may have a preference for white girls he doesn't have much of a chance with one so he should instead pursue a non-White girl.

Asian guys are penalized by their looks because I don't see them as being significantly less social, athletic, intelligent, wealthy, etc. Facial looks are genetic and cannot be changed easily. Having a fit body helps but not nearly as much as for white or black guys.

I wish it weren't true.

EDIT: Basically I'm saying Asian men are at a significant disadvantage in the dating scene especially if they are attracted to white women, and most comments so far seem to be confirming that view.

"Bar soap is all you need.

And you dont wash your hair at all, you just rinse it. 

Sometimes I use shampoo, maybe once in a month or two, if I did something specially dirty or got chemicals in my hair etc. But your hair is healthier without it, and if I cared enough to find an alternative I would use something natural.

If you quit using shampoo, your hair might be greasy for the first couple days, but with nothing but proper rinsing your hair will be able to clean itself.

Face wash is unnecessary as well. Bar soap is fine. Special body washes are unnecessary. It is all a marketing ploy.

I am a clean and beautiful boy who has no problem attracting the opposite sex, and have never been led to suspect that my habits are somehow smelly or unclean.

While I do work with women (not enough men for stable work), I am proud of my ability to help men (who come to me with little or no understanding of how it all works) get better, healthier skin and hair that they can be comfortable with. 

Because it always needs to be said: Nothing stated here constitutes medical advice for a medical condition.  If you have concerns, please consult a medical professional.

Enough of the jibber-jabber...

&gt; Bar soap is all you need.

Technically, yes.  That is a cleansing agent.  It will clean you.

Specifically, no.  Different cleansers will effect different skins in different ways.  Using one that is ""right"" for you will make a MASSIVE difference.

Regarding soaps:  Differing skin types (oily, dry, acne prone, patchy, etc.) have different needs.  One of the larger factors to consider is the skins pH level - those that run more alkaline (oily, flawless skin) need to have soaps that are non-abrasive.  Bar soaps are usually more alkaline than liquid cleansers, but are not usually alkaline enough for most people.  This caused bar soaps to strip away the skins natural oils and jack the skin up by overly drying it, leading to acne and blemish spots over time.  Those with acne and patchy dry skin typically want face wash that contains sulfur or salicylic acid (reduces redness from acne), as it helps reduce oil production and keeps the size of pores down.  Those with dry skin without acne want something that keeps the moisture up (cream-based foaming cleansers work best) but is able to be effective against clogged pores.

That's just for the face.

If you want to get into the myriad of different hair types and the benefits of using product designed for those types, I could.  There are tons of things that can make a huge impact, especially for those with medium to longer hairstyles.

By the things you are saying - ""will anything clean me better than a bar of soap?""  No, not really - it won't make you less or more clean by using something else.  It will, however, be a massive benefit to those who need the benefit of using matched products.

The best example I can give you it that you claim bar soap works just fine.  With bar soaps, there is so much difference in terms of moisture control and pH that I can find something at Target that will make your face look like shit and I can also find something that will make your face feel like a velvet couch at Target.

The difference between common, conventional brands is massive.  Dove is geared to be almost pH neutral, where as Irish Spring isn't.  Not that I personally endorse either product (I don't).

Yes, there are people that have minimal effects from using specific products (usually oily skin with VERY tight pore structure), and their skin is capable of working with most everything.  Perhaps you are just one of those people.

My 20 year high school reunion is this year, and I am frequently assumed to be in my mid-to-late 20's, not 38.  I'm not baby-faced, I have skin that I take care of in a way that is beneficial to it.  My morning and evening routine takes 15 seconds, as I rarely apply cleansers to my face - just oil, specifically certified organic argan oil. That's about it for my needs, but others need to spend 5-10 minutes every day to get their skin to the point where they are happy with it.

It really is trail and error:  We gotta play around as see what works, but I can usually get it right within two shots. 

***Some things I can guess at based on your statements:***

Your hair is fine, thinner individual thickness than the average person.  It has a natural oil towards it, but not overly so. Your hair follicle distribution is probably on the thinner side naturally, not from hair loss (think ""less dense than an afro"").   Your scalp is also slightly oily, but not overly so.  If your hair is longer than 5 inches (almost a guaranteed no here), you probably have some breakage and split ends that you need haircuts every month or so to remove.  You may have a diet that is processing B vitamins (niacin, B-5, and B-12) in a higher concentration than normal and you probably are consuming solid amounts of calcium and/or silica if you are not having breakage with longer hair.

If you have long hair and white pillow cases, they will show a serious difference in coloration due to the oil being consistently applied to them.  That is assuming that you wash your pillow case once a week or less.

Your nails might be showing straight lines from the bed to the tip.
Also, your nail beds probably are damaged, and the skin around the nails are not the same level of moisture as compared to the rest of your hands.  The skin around the sides and bottom probably crack or peel back frequently.  Ask a woman if you have no idea what I am talking about what I say ""nail beds"".  

Also, obviously, I am assuming that you are a man.

Your skin is probably naturally soft, rather than leathery.  It is most likely drier than it should be, but since you rarely wash your face (if at all), you have not stripped what little natural oil is able to get to the skins surface - and it appears to be good.  You most likely have some blackheads, although they are probably quite small, and you have more of them than is considered normal in certain spots (nose, upper cheek, etc.).  If you rub your hand on your forehead, it probably releases dirt on contact (in little lines).  It also, if rubbed hard and for 5 seconds, will probably become flaky and irritated (red for longer than 20 seconds).

Also: Hair doesn't clean itself.  Nothing does.  Rinsing helps remove dirt and grime if you have naturally smooth hair.  I am guessing that you have smooth hair, without kinks.  If you don't use a cleanser, you probably are benefiting from your hairs naturally slightly oily state (which is uncommon for most people).  I actually encourage people to wash their hair 2 times a week, and to condition it 3 times a week (on average).  You don't want to strip the oils by using a cleanser, and if you do, you should always use a conditioner to replace the oils you removed.

Also, while you might be doing well with the ladies - it's not your current hygiene routine that is doing it. I would guess that you are naturally a decent guy with a positive attitude, above average intelligence and solid looks. That can overcome some things like smelly hair and a few small blackheads that you don't notice but the ladies do.

However, you could also be rich.

Anyways, the point of these products - most people need them to feel like they look their best. However, everyone can benefit from using specialized products, even those that are blessed with minimum-maintenance skin and hair. 

***Going out on a limb here and guessing your sex, age, nationality, other fun shit to guess at:***

You are a male, 16-29 (specifically 18-23), most likely Caucasian (possibly Latin or Native American, and higher chances that you are Asian), straight to wavy hair, probably with some serious Mediterranean/Balkan/Eastern European or Asian genes in the family (mostly on your mothers side if most of these guesses are right). You have dark hair, possibly black but most likely brown.  You eat very little garlic, unless served hot like soups.  You probably consume more that 2 ounces of cheese or dairy a day, or consume calcium in decent amounts - this only applies if you are over 24 years old, if not, than you may not be consuming any calcium. You have long eyelashes but not as many as everyone else, and possibly very few on your bottom eyelids.  You don't see a lot of sun compared to others your age.  You most likely work indoors and you don't have a manual labor job like construction.

Just some guesses.  Who the fuck knows.","I have a beard. If I get food in my beard shampoo is very much needed. If I have been working on a car or something and get oil in my beard shampoo is very much needed. If I have been doing a bunch of fry cooking and have splashed cooking oil onto my beard shampoo is very much needed. 

So no, just rinsing is not always sufficient. 

Bar soap is horrid for my beard. It makes it dry and brittle as well as itchy. 

It is true that daily use of shampoo is not good for hair, and that for many unless they are involved in messy activies do not actually need to shampoo more than once a week one. That truth however does not support your claim that it is wholly unnecessary. All that it takes is one instance that it is necessary to prove you wrong and I listed several. 

The point of using a body wash is to apply a scent to your body that is lighter than cologne or perfume. The purpose of shampoo is to strip your hair of oils and dirt.

Also, while you might be doing well with the ladies - it's not your current hygiene routine that is doing it. I would guess that you are naturally a decent guy with a positive attitude, above average intelligence and solid looks. That can overcome some things like smelly hair and a few small blackheads that you don't notice but the ladies do.

However, you could also be rich.

Anyways, the point of these products - most people need them to feel like they look their best. However, everyone can benefit from using specialized products, even those that are blessed with minimum-maintenance skin and hair. 

***Going out on a limb here and guessing your sex, age, nationality, other fun shit to guess at:***

You are a male, 16-29 (specifically 18-23), most likely Caucasian (possibly Latin or Native American, and higher chances that you are Asian), straight to wavy hair, probably with some serious Mediterranean/Balkan/Eastern European or Asian genes in the family (mostly on your mothers side if most of these guesses are right). You have dark hair, possibly black but most likely brown.  You eat very little garlic, unless served hot like soups.  You probably consume more that 2 ounces of cheese or dairy a day, or consume calcium in decent amounts - this only applies if you are over 24 years old, if not, than you may not be consuming any calcium. You have long eyelashes but not as many as everyone else, and possibly very few on your bottom eyelids.  You don't see a lot of sun compared to others your age.  You most likely work indoors and you don't have a manual labor job like construction.

Just some guesses.  Who the fuck knows.","I have a beard. If I get food in my beard shampoo is very much needed. If I have been working on a car or something and get oil in my beard shampoo is very much needed. If I have been doing a bunch of fry cooking and have splashed cooking oil onto my beard shampoo is very much needed. 

So no, just rinsing is not always sufficient. 

Bar soap is horrid for my beard. It makes it dry and brittle as well as itchy. 

It is true that daily use of shampoo is not good for hair, and that for many unless they are involved in messy activies do not actually need to shampoo more than once a week one. That truth however does not support your claim that it is wholly unnecessary. All that it takes is one instance that it is necessary to prove you wrong and I listed several. 

The point of using a body wash is to apply a scent to your body that is lighter than cologne or perfume. The purpose of shampoo is to strip your hair of oils and dirt. They are not a scam, they do what they are intended to do. ",r1,0.5,0.3,0.4,0.3,0.6,0.0,0.8,0.7,0.7,0.5,0.4,0.6,0.4,0.5,0.0,0.7,0.3,0.6,0.8,0.5,r1,,
"**Edit: Ok guy's, my views have been changed on this subject. The reason is because essentially it causes ripple effects, and has effects on the followers. Additionally, We may not know if the intern at hand is doing it out of consent, or to keep their job, and it's hard to know. Thanks, I honestly did not think it would be that easy to change my views on this**


Ok, I am not advocating for everyone to go pull Lewinskies or anything, but what I'm saying is that they shouldn't be impeached or forced to resign, or face criticism on their ability to lead or shape policy. If they are a good policy maker fine. If they are making the world a better place and fighting for things that other politicians are afraid to then fine. As long as they don't be hypocrites on their policies, so what. Really the Clinton and Lewinsky scandal should have been handled between Bill and his wife, not the media and Congress. A city councilman just stepped down in my city for sexting someone 14 years his junior, however she was 34 and he's 48 neither one married, he's divorced a few years ago... how the hell does that call for a career to be ended? And now the speaker of the Missouri house of reps just resigned because he was sexting the capitol intern. If it was abuse or assault then ok, investigate, charge and punish them appropriately, but if its a matter of consensual legal sexual exchange, who are we to tell them no? I really wanna know why we shame politicians and ruin their careers because of things like sexting?

There are several issues here, but they all relate to two critical qualities required for all leaders: trust of those they lead; and, an appreciation of the emotional context of the people under them. 

For people in political positions there are two groups for whom they act as leaders. The first is their constituency, the people who elected them. The second is their staff. The trust and support of both is necessary for their success. If they are also chairs of particular committees there may be additional groups as well related to the uniqueness of their particular position. 

For years, the model in America was to assume that emotion has no role in managerial decisions, and thus no real role in leadership. But we now know that this simply isn't true. All decision making is driven by emotional biases, and research into the neurobiology of leadership shows that employee innovation and engagement improves significantly when leaders promote positive emotional responses in those who follow them -- which starts with the leaders own actions (Zhou, Cheng &amp; Xia, 2014). 

But what's really interesting is that people who follow leaders respond physiologically differently to leaders who are seen as deserving of being followed (Boyatzis et al., 2012). The research shows that when a leader is trusted, what they say is actually processed differently in the brain than when a leader is not trusted. Leaders who lose trust of those who follow them literally can not be heard the same way again because the emotional centers of the brain direct the brain to actually process incoming messages from those leaders differently. 

Molenberghs et al. (2015) showed that semantic processing for leaders who are seen as trusted actually activate mirror neurons in followers who thus feel a strong connection and desire to follow that person, specifically in the areas of hte bilateral pars opercularis, bilateral rostral inferior parietal lobule and the posterior midcingulate cortex. This processing does not happen when leaders are not seen as worthy of the follower. In other words, a leader's effectiveness is dependent upon the selective neural processing of those they lead. You can't fake that by pretending you didn't lose trust. 

Social identification with a leader by the followers is essential to leader success. A leader who has broken social trust by being involved in scandal is in a very difficult position.

The short version of all of this is that while leaders can recover from scandal, it requires that at least one of the two groups they need for success (the staff or the constituency) see the scandal not as the leader breaking social trust with them, but as the leader being attacked from outside the ""in group"" that the leader represents. If that is the case, then the leader has some chance of recovery. Of the two groups, it is actually the staff, not the constituents, who matter most for political leaders in most cases (unless they are currently engaged in an active campaign effort), because constituents have a short memory, but immediate success or failure is dependent upon the staff. 

What is problematic is that self-inflicted scandal like this tends to be extremely disheartening to the staff. Several studies have linked self-inflicted scandal with significant reduction in staff performance. 

If a political leader has figured out that he has lost support of his staff, his constituency, and to some extent his party, it very well may simply not be worth it to try to fight it out. Once you've changed the way people think about you, it's physiologically impossible for things to go backwards. You can't disassociate that memory and the resulting loss of trust, and thus you can't change the automatic low-level neural processing that determines how people literally are able to hear what you say. 

Now, the following is speculation, not science, but: one of the reasons I think Clinton survived is that the GOP turned the Lewinsky thing into a GOP versus Democrat affair. This enabled the White House staff to see the entire thing as an external threat and attack. Had the GOP not gone after Clinton in such a partisan fashion, and instead focused on something like ""the public shame of him abusing his position of power to take advantage of his staff,"" he likely would have had a much worse time of it.

"I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into taking her's husband's last name, and gay spouses also have a conundrum of their own. 

However, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. One small example is if you work in an industry where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind (like I do). It's helpful to know in advance who is related to who by just looking at a piece of paper.

BUT, if the wife and the husband choose not to share a last name, please God settle on one name for your kid. Just flip a coin for which last name your kid takes if that's what you need to do. Don't make everyone around him have to deal with saying and writing out Reginald Henry Lieberman-Montgomery. 

A metaphor I would make for this would be gender pronouns. You have the right to tell me whether you identify as a man or a woman, but I swear to God if you insist that everyone around you refer to you strictly with the gender neutral pronouns Ni, Nem and Nir, I will be having none of it. 

As a counterpoint, I will say that I can't ever imagine myself taking my wife's last name. And if she chose not to take mine, I think I would feel a little disappointed. Further, I can't imagine feeling comfortable with my kid not taking my last name. So I already recognize a bit of the hypocrisy. In that way, I see that I am posing a problem without an apparent solution. On top of your rebuttals, I would also be curious to hear alternative ideas/social structures that could work to level the playing field, AND prevent me from having to say a mouthful. 

**EDIT:**

Apologies for the day long delay-- car emergency took all night and all morning.

Thanks for all your responses! Here are some of my views you've changed. 

Spain &gt; 'Murica. There's a clear system in place in Spanish countries that actually speaks to my ""one family name"" point. People consistently take the fathers, then mother's surname. Then the kid's kids will do the same. Gives you family history and also something to put on your mailbox. 

What I personally like about this is that it's uniform. If two last names were adopted country-wide in America, I would have much less of a problem with it. 

I also want to clarify: My problem with the ""mouthful"" of hyphenated last names does not mean that I would also suggest gentrifying the Krzyzewskis and the Chevaprevadumrongs of the world. To shorten your family name is to bastardize it. No ill feelings to those with shortened last names of course-- my last name was actually gentrified two generations ago. 

Finally, here is a post that very well summarizes my American sentiments: 

&gt; While this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to “People who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. People who name their kids something I dislike or don’t understand are selfish and stupid.” You have not said this, but I think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated.

&gt; You want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. If a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate.

My American sensibilities that shorter is better are deeply ingrained and will probably be there 'til I die. That said, at least I can recognize them so that I know to keep them in check. 

While I will continue to make fun of people who have two last names, it will be with the same conviction that I make fun of everyone else. No hostility here.

Thanks guys!","I think it's useful to be able to identify a family on the basis of last names, and so I think it's useful for everyone to share the same label.

And this is exactly why hyphenation is such a useful thing. If you meet a group of people who share the last name ""Montegue-Capulet"" then you immediately understand that they are a family unit, and you also understand something about the ancestry from both sides of the family. Additionally, hyphenation also scores points for upholding some form of gender equality.

Of course, it's impractical to expect people's names to grow exponentially in size with every generation - but this doesn't have to be a problem- it's easy to resolve: when someone gets married, the son keeps only the father's name and the daughters keep only the mother's - and then they hyphenate with their spouse. We can also adopt the convention that the man's name always comes first in the hyphenation - even better - now we know both their family ties and ancestry (I don't care about how it's ordered, we just need to decide).

In summary, it only takes three names (one first, two last) to identify a person, their family unit, their family ties, and their ancestry in a complete and fair way.  Saying two last names does take longer than one, but last names are only really used for official purposes, and under formal situations. And - people are already hyphenating.

"Greetings!

I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay.

However, as far as my understanding of History goes, Humanity kept uniting into bigger and bigger groups.

I'm not sure whether my order is correct, but it's merely to give an example of what I am seeing.

First, families started working together as it was easier to hunt that way  
Then, they started to form small tribal communities  
Then, these tribal communities united into alliances and ""great tribes""  
Then, the tribes became petty kingdoms  
Then, the petty kingdoms were either swallowed by a larger one, or swallowed the smaller ones.  
Then, the kingdoms they formed kept absorbing the smaller communities that were similar in culture

And then there are countries like the United States and Russia, both spanning almost entire continents or more. Likewise, they have the strongest presence as well. The United Kingdom had an equally great presence during its Imperial days, which it more or less managed to retain.

I feel Europe could easily raise its economy to the third power if each current country paid its tax to a single, central government that viewed each part of the union equally, at most... with different strategies, investiture focuses.

The main counter arguement I see against an united Europe is cultural decay or incompatibility, but I do not understand how it would get in the way too much. Culture won't disappear just because people answer to a single elected government, neither will it disappear due to people wandering within the borders.

"Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a pedantic point. Please don't let it dissuade you from answering. Also, the title should read: ""there is no *consistent* moral framework"". The mere existence of a framework is not a very interesting point to debate.

A few things first: I do eat meat, and I don't want have sex with animals. I believe both eating meat and having sex with animals are wrong. I think that the reason that I eat meat despite believing it is wrong is that it's simply what I've been doing my whole life.

Okay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry.

Consider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: http://www.wikihow.com/Collect-Semen-from-a-Bull-for-a-Breeding-Soundness-Exam

How can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus?

I don't see a justification for either behavior on 'natural' grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally (that is to say, not artificially) there are plenty of things which occur naturally (rape, infanticide, kidnapping) that we all agree are immoral.

After giving out three deltas, I think my view on the question as I posed it has been changed. I think if I could go back in time I would probably have said ""CMV: If it is immoral to have sex with animals, then it is immoral to eat them"" but as far as the existence of consistent moral frameworks justifying one of the behaviours but not the other, I am thoroughly convinced.

"As a lifelong classical musician, I am absolutely in love with the repertoire of symphony orchestras, opera, and chamber music. I am always trying to think of ways to introduce the music to a wider audience and get more people to love listening to classical music. 

So here it is: I believe that the main reason people don't like listening to classical music as much as other genres is because classical music rarely includes a drum set. 

Definitions I use in this CMV: 

Classical music: not only music from the classical period. I'm using the blanket term to describe any music typically performed by orchestras, or chamber ensembles. What a non-musician would think of as ""classical."" Everything from Bach to Mahler to Bartok to Ives. 

Popular music: not just the narrow genre of ""pop,"" but the broad term to include anything listened to by a more mainstream audience. Could include anything from oldies, to country, to EDM, to metal, and beyond. 

Now to explain my view:

I really don't think there's that much difference between classical music and other genres. 

-Both genres use the same 12 notes. (The exception obviously being microtonal classical music, which even as a career classical musician, sometimes I have a really hard time appreciating. But 99.9% of classical music uses the same 12 notes as popular music.)

-Both use the same basic palette of harmonies and tonalities (major/minor chords, added 7ths, 9ths, etc.). 

-Both have the same basic choices of meters. (4/4 time, mixed meter, etc.)

-Both use many of the same instruments. (Guitars aren't exclusive to popular music, and violins and 'celli aren't exclusive to orchestras.)

-Both contain pieces with text/lyrics, and both genres also contain pieces that are purely instrumental. (A lot of people point to lyrics as the main reason they love certain genres of popular music, but both genres have music with text/lyrics.)

-In the pieces with text/lyrics, both genres use many languages besides English. (Lots of people say they can't understand classical music sung in German, yet they listen to plenty of K-pop or songs in French and don't mind looking up a translation, or they appreciate it for other aspects besides the lyrics.)

-Both genres contain relatively short pieces (3-5 minutes) and longer pieces (10+, or even 60 minutes+). (So the length of composition isn't really a big factor, since you can find both short and long pieces in either genre.)

So those are many of the similarities I can think of. But one thing that's really different between most (not all) classical music and most (not all) of popular music is the fact that the drumset (or electronic beat, or incredibly rhythmic or percussive strumming on a guitar, or vocal percussion, or something that makes a similar sound) keeps really obvious control of the rhythm at all times. It's really hard not to know where the beat is in popular music, whereas in classical music, sometimes the meter is a bit more obscure. 

I think that most people really like feeling their body or mind move in time with the music, and so the accessibility of the rhythmic feel in popular genres is appealing to a wider audience. 

Contrast this to classical music, where sometimes, even to a trained musician, the meter is intentionally less clear. In most cases, the meter may be clear to someone who knows what they're listening for, but still not totally obvious to the average music listener. It gives people less of a rhythmic foothold into the piece, which I contend is the reason that people don't enjoy classical music as much.

To clarify: I'm not coming from a place of thinking classical music is better. I'm not assigning value judgments here, or trying to be an elitist. I'm merely trying to find what I would consider the main differences between classical and popular genres to be. And to me, the lack of a drumset (or other instrument that keeps the meter as a very up-front feature) in classical music seems to be the biggest difference that I can spot. 

One final caveat: In this CMV, I'm mostly talking about listening to music on one's own, like at your house, or on your own iPod. I think the experience of attending a concert of classical music vs. pop music is a really different one. I don't blame anyone that thinks that orchestra concerts can feel a bit stuffy. So while people may enjoy the more energetic atmosphere at a popular music concert, I don't think there's much difference to putting on your iPod while you go for a run and listening to Beethoven vs. the Beatles when you're on your own and not in a concert setting. 

The reason I'd like my view changed: I truly want to know the reasons that most people would have for not loving classical music so that I can address that in my future performance and teaching in the hopes of exposing a wider swath of the population to an art form that I love so much. I truly believe that classical music is universal and anyone can enjoy it. But I need to start by finding out the real reasons that people don't already listen to it. 

The main thing that I think will CMV: 

-Compelling examples of features people like about popular music that are unique to popular music. Not features that are shared between both genres. I really want to find out what makes popular styles uniquely engaging to people in ways that classical music is not. 

TL;DR: Classical music almost never has a drumset to help keep really clear track of the time for the listener. People like feeling rhythmically grounded, and so popular styles are more accessible to a wider audience.

"Hi.

Whenever I read about people trying to 

- increase the number of women in science or engineering
- increase the number of women in politics
- increase the number of women in positions of power
- increase the number of women that are firefighters or police

I can't help feeling that it is a rather useless cause. I have no problem at all with there being less women than men in any place. What I would (and do) have a problem with is women having it more difficult than men to enter certain professions. That is the real problem we should, as a society, try to solve.

The current approach is ""forcing"" the proportion of women to increase, by means of: 

- gender-specific student grants, 
- positions reserved for women, 
- lower physical requirements,
- etc.

As I see it this kind of solutions are problematic in two ways:

- They involve so-called ""positive discrimination"", which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman. This is absurd and can increase animosity in the male coworkers. Admittedly, that would be wrong on their part, but it still can create an hostile work environment.

- They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. 

The only benefits I see is that ""artificially"" increasing the number of women in certain places may make the presence of women in said place appear less ""unusual"" to society, thereby decreasing the discrimination, but I still think they do more harm than good.

Reddit, change my view!

PD: English is not my first language, so I apologize for any awkwardly phrased sentence I may have written, and welcome any correction. 

EDIT: In only a few hours there have been a lot of great answers that have confirmed my feeling that this was a more nuanced issue that I could even imagine. My view has been changed in that I had underestimated the benefits of this kind of measures. In particular I now see that:

- Artificially increasing the number of women in certain fields makes said fields much less ""threatening"" to other women.
- Makes male coworkers appreciate the capabilities of women, decreasing further discrimination.
- Improves the selection process by eliminating male-favoring biases. Whenever a man less prepared than a woman would have got the position by conscious or unconscious biases a well-prepared woman will get it.

I remain unconvinced that physical tests should have easier versions for women. Most people seemed to agree with me on this, though. I have realized, however, that jobs that at first seem to be mainly physical (police, firefighters, ...) would also benefit from having more women. 

Some of my favourite answers, where you can find studies supporting all of this, are:

I don't think it is. Every field that is dominantly one gender over another is going to miss out on talented people with novel insights. We shouldn't miss out on a qualified nurse because some bloke was told it wasn't a manly profession. Neither should we miss out on a qualified scientists because some girl was told science was for boys.

Unless you have a good argument as for why certain genders are almost universally better at certain professions any sort of gender imbalance is going to cause society missing out on qualified people in the right place.

And I think the police force is a special case, in this regard. I've seen firsthand how some people react to both male and female police officers and having a good gender balance is going to help civilians a lot. A lot of people are more comfortable discussing certain things with people from their own gender. Children will gravitate towards female police officers (and yes, this is also due to harmful gender roles in society, but we need a police that functions in the society we live in, not in the society we'd like to live in). 

&gt; They involve so-called ""positive discrimination"", which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman.

People often say this when talking about this, but I don't think this is completely true. We know from several studies that when applying for, well, anything, people are discriminated against based on their gender, skin color, sexuality, etc. Even if the resumes are completely identical, this still happens. So if a woman wants to enter a male dominated field, there's a good chance she's going to have to be **more** qualified than a man. Positive discrimination is intended to get (in this case) women accepted when they are ""merely"" equally qualified. 

&gt; They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. 

And as soon as we have good, viable way to stop the discrimination from happening at all, we should implement that.

"I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form.

The facts are:

* McDonalds brewed (and continues to brew) coffee at standard brewing temperatures of 200F 
* McDonalds holds and serves its coffee after brewing between 170-180F (which is no different than most other restaurants)
* McDonalds has *NOT* lowered the temperature of their coffee, nor have the changed the temps at which they hold and serve coffee

To me, the purchaser of coffee acknowledges the fact that they're buying near-boiling water when they decided ""hey, I want coffee"". Change my view, please.

Such a difference between McDonald's coffee and other coffee in the city means that a customer has a reasonable expectation for coffee at any given restaurant to be in a similar range of temperature.  By exceeding that range, McDonald's was giving the customer that had a significantly increased risk of injury associated with it without any warning that theirs was different from similar products in other places.","&gt; McDonalds brewed (and continues to brew) coffee at standard brewing temperatures of 200F

This is not a new phenomenon - the entire history of the industrial age is replete with labor-fueled resentment from the lower-class establishment toward foreigners trying to take their place.

Still, despite this - I can't help but get pissed when liberals rag on the native working class as ""Rednecks"" or ""Bogans"" (Or for black people trying to get ahead, ""Uncle Toms"") that supposedly vote against their own best interest by voting to halt immigration. This might be the only form of protectionism I can genuinely sympathize with. Please change my view - I'm open to your ideas.

Immigrants do not prevent socialism either. Just look as how Canada is far more socialist the the USA despite the fact that it has a much larger amount of immigrants. Burundi, which receives almost no immigrants, is very non-socialist.

The reason immigrants are selected as the scapegoat is multifaceted. 

1. They are unable to vote, making them an easy target for politicians
2. They are less relatable because of their cultural differences

Well your society and any society with heavy diversity will definitely face varying levels of these problems no matter what type of institutions are used. Humans naturally like to put things in mental categories, so with all forms of diversity someone is facing unequal adversity at somepoint.

"First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and I can admit when I am wrong.

I do not buy into the whole argument of 'just because our parents brought us into the world, we owe them our lives.' Whether a child was brought into the world by choice or not, I don't think that being born should impose a debt of respect on the child. 

Furthermore, I think that this respect needs to be earned. I define respect in this context as 'regard for another person's rational ability, trusting that they can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out.'

This is why I think that giving the reason 'because I said so' is a total cop out. If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect. 

Don't get me wrong, I think it is crucial for a child to be told when they are wrong so that they don't grow up into narcissistic asshats. However, I think that they deserve a logical conversation with a parent until one side admits, of his own accord, that he is in the wrong.

"In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want to is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to things that are unacceptable to do to a person without his or her permission. Telling someone that they can't get a medical procedure done (or, likewise, telling that they HAVE to get a medical procedure done) is just as awful as is dictating how they were their hair or how they dress. In that same vein, what makes it okay in our society for your significant other to dictate who you sleep with? 

Sex in our society is a recreational activity enjoyed by most adults in at least some capacity. People dictating what their SOs do for fun in their free time seems rather controlling. Adults should feel free to do what their bodies what they wish as long as they aren't physically forcing another person to do something. Forcing another person to only have sex with you seems to me like an awfully controlling behavior and takes away the body autonomy that they should have. 

I can understand if a couple decides between the two of them that would like to sleep exclusively with each other. It's just surprising to me at times that it is the norm to be mad enough at your SO to break up with them if they have sex with someone outside of the relationship. I understand that people cheat all the time, but open relationships just seem to be the exception rather than the norm. 

If you want a monogamous relationship and your SO sleeps with someone else, then you shouldn't be mad at your SO. You should simply realize that you guys want different things out of a relationship and part ways. Getting angry would be controlling your SO and taking away his or her own control over his or her own body. 

And just for clarification: I am not saying that everyone should go out and cheat on their SOs. I am more stating that it *should* be normal and acceptable for people to have sex with people outside of a two person relationship for no other reason than that it is oddly controlling to insist that your SO sleep with no one besides you. 

Also, I wanted to point out that I am purposefully not using particular genders. It is just as bad to for a woman to tell a man he can't have sex outside the relationship as it would be if a man told a woman the same thing. 

So, please. Change my view! Why should it be the norm to have monogamous relationships?

"I am a 23 year old male Indian American male. I have never held hands with a girl, been kissed, or obviously had sex. I have never even asked someone out. I do not think a girl has expressed even the slightest interest in me. I graduated from college last year and am about to start med school in a month. I had been fat for years but lost all the weight over the past year and am pretty fit now. I am only 5ft 4 tall however. I do think facially I am slight above average and I wouldn't call myself ugly. My family struggled  financially and I focused on academics like a madman and was able to go to a great college and am headed to a great med school. It is my ticket to a better life. Yet I believe strongly that life will be one of loneliness. Internally I am angry and bitter even as all my friends think I must be so happy to start this next chapter of my life.

"Lets start by looking at a situation:

Imagine you are walking by a shallow river on your way to a ball when you see a child drowning. You're wearing some pretty expensive clothes (lets say 500 pounds) that will no doubt be ruined if you jump into the river. Saving this child doesn't put you in danger as you can stand in this river while the child being smaller cannot. Do you jump into that river to save that child? 

Let's say you encounter that same river with a different child in it the next day while wearing your rolex watch. Do you jump into that river to save the child? 

Now lets look at the real world. More than 1.3 billion people live in extreme poverty (less than 80p a day) and 7.6 million children are estimated to have died before their 5th birthday in 2010. Many of these are from poverty, preventable diseases and illnesses. Money can help provide infrastructure for schools, hospitals, sanitation facilities, vaccinations etc which no doubt will help reduce child mortality rates. Once you look at the world through this lens then it is easy enough to look at the world in terms of opportunity cost. This iphone or 100 life saving vaccinations. An expensive house or cheap government housing and a new well providing water for a village. One may argue that there is a difference between the example and this and that is distance. These children are much further away but I don't see how that dilutes your moral responsibility to them. Therefore, it seems that any money that you keep must be worth a child's life, education etc or be allocated to some other duty such as child rearing where you have a responsibility to give time and money (for schools, healthcare etc) to make sure that your child grows up to be a socially productive member of society. I know that sounds like a very cold perspective on what parenting is about but i couldn't think of another way to phrase it haha.

I will assume that most people think that you should save the child but this specifically is why I would save the child. I'm looking at this from the stance of virtue ethics (Aquinas) and I believe that by allowing this child to die shows a lack of charity and isn't positively building character. I can't justify losing a life in exchange for 500 pounds.

But,  I think even taken from the stance of consequentialism (believing that consequences should inform your moral thinking) or deontological ethics (believing that laws inform your moral stance) you would still reach the eventual conclusion that you must jump into that river:

Consequentialism (i.e. Utilitarianism):
You would have to argue that having 500 pounds will lead to greater pleasure/happiness than that life and I don't think you can justify that.

Deontological ethics (i.e. Kant):
I only really understand Kant so he's the one that I will briefly (very briefly) talk about but allowing that child to die breaks the categorical imperative as if you allowed that act to become universal you would be devaluing human life by saying that it has a price tag.

I've only briefly talked about why I think the child should be saved as I take it as a assumption that most people would save the child but I will be willing to discuss my ethical stance more thoroughly if anyone asks me about it but i didn't want my post to only appeal to those who have studied philosophy.

Thanks for your answers!

Additionally, I really don't think you sufficiently dealt with Kantian ethics at all (I wasn't convinced by your account of the categorical imperative, and you ignored the other components of Kantian ethics, which I actually think make a stronger case for you, specifically the second formulation), and it seems like you misunderstood virtue ethics: it isn't about maximising behaviour that conforms with a particular virtue, it's about cultivating the virtue itself. Virtue ethics demands that you are a charitable person, not that you perform maximally charitable actions. Under an Aristotelean framework (which is essentially what Aquinas operates under), it's very easy to be *too* charitable, as well, which I think is worth considering. 

Regardless though, some common critiques of the view your espousing would be:

- It's impossible to accurately quantify 'happiness' in such a way that would allow you to make the assumptions you're making

- Ethics isn't the highest thing we should aspire to

- You have unique ethical responsibilities to people who are closer to you (i.e. that space is morally relevant)

- Utilitarianism is heavily flawed, and your argument doesn't really work for any other major school of ethics

"You always hear the saying, ""it's like comparing apples and oranges,"" in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the chance to prove to you that apples are the better, more versatile fruit.

Alcohol: drinking is awesome and fun. Rarely do you hear about anything orange though, outside of being a garnish or in liquers. Apples are the full feature alcohol fruit that can come in cider or wine form, as well and being used in the same fashions oranges could, liquers and garnishes. No one orders an orange wine because they just aren't common, and that's because they aren't very good! Apple is even sometimes used in beer, albeit orange is more common for that.

Food: oranges are pretty good for food, salads sauces and such, but what about an orange pie? As an American the apple pie is a quintessential food associated with America. That may not sway non Americans, with that I say, what about pork? You don't put an orange in a pigs mouth when you roast it, nope that's an apple. Both can be used in a variety of ways, but pie and pork gives apple the advantage.

Diversity: apples have over 7,000 varieties, oranges don't even come close to that. 

Juice: both make fine juices, but apple has far more variety to create a wide appeal. Apple juice also comes in carbonated form commonly. That's pretty cool.

Pop culture: the technology company Apple owes most of it's success because of the apple, spwcifically McIntosh apples. If macs were called ""Navels"" or ""Valencia"" instead would Apple have been so successful? Not a chance orange fans, sorry to burst your bubble. Also Forrest Gump's infamous line, ""life is like a crate of apples..."" Would never work with oranges due to lack of variety. Lastly, there's no Johnny Orangeseed, check and mate.

Love to hear orange fans change my mind though, let's see it.

No one orders an orange wine because they just aren't common, and that's because they aren't very good! Apple is even sometimes used in beer, albeit orange is more common for that.

Food: oranges are pretty good for food, salads sauces and such, but what about an orange pie? As an American the apple pie is a quintessential food associated with America. That may not sway non Americans, with that I say, what about pork? You don't put an orange in a pigs mouth when you roast it, nope that's an apple. Both can be used in a variety of ways, but pie and pork gives apple the advantage.

Diversity: apples have over 7,000 varieties, oranges don't even come close to that. 

Juice: both make fine juices, but apple has far more variety to create a wide appeal. Apple juice also comes in carbonated form commonly. That's pretty cool.

Pop culture: the technology company Apple owes most of it's success because of the apple, spwcifically McIntosh apples. If macs were called ""Navels"" or ""Valencia"" instead would Apple have been so successful? Not a chance orange fans, sorry to burst your bubble. Also Forrest Gump's infamous line, ""life is like a crate of apples..."" Would never work with oranges due to lack of variety. Lastly, there's no Johnny Orangeseed, check and mate.

Love to hear orange fans change my mind though, let's see it.

- Easier to travel with. Throw an orange into a dirty bag, the part you eat stays clean. Don't have a plate to put it on? The peel suffices.

- An orange is cleaner to eat. Both because of the peel, and because it naturally segments. Very hard to eat an apple without getting sticky juice all over you. I hate the feeling of sticky face and hands after eating an apple.

- Hard to make an argument about taste as preferences differ, but personally I find apples pretty boring. Citrus is more interesting to me.

&gt; Alcohol

Not really a pro for apples themselves. There are also orange liqueurs. I'd say that apples are used for alcohol more for convenience historically, and now tradition, rather than any inherent advantage. Somewhere in Africa there is liquor made by the tribe's women all chewing up some plant matter and spitting it into a big pot to ferment (really, I swear, I saw it on an odd food show). That's not really a benefit to spit.

&gt; Food

An orange pie seems possible, it's just that other citrus works slightly better for it (key lime pie...) 

&gt; Diversity

Perhaps the original form of the orange is better to begin with, so there's less need to create many variations. Also, if wide variations are allowed, I'd get to include many other types of citrus as benefits to oranges. A lemon, lime, grapefruit, pomelo etc are likely about as similar to oranges as the many breeds of apples are to each other, right? (cue biologist to tell me how wrong we are)

"There is an increasing trend in the UK of 'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a certificate and to celebrate that milestone, and as such should be restricted to University courses, and at a push to cover people at the end of High School (so that the people who go straight into work celebrate an end of their formal education).

I appreciate that schools and the pupils want to celebrate the end of their time at that school, but placing children in garishly-coloured robes at the age of 7 only cheapens what a 'graduation' stands for. **There are other ways they can celebrate a new beginning without appropriating and trampling on existing ceremonies and traditions**

To give a comparison, consider how engineers in the US and Canada are given an iron ring in a ceremony to symbolise their obligation. The ring and the associated ceremony is a very personal symbol of their choices and achievements to the engineers. Now imagine how they would feel if every single infant school started copying their ceremony word for word, item for item, issuing iron rings to 7 year olds telling them it means the same.

My son is supposed to have a 'graduation' in a few months, and the vast majority of the parents are planning a boycott, organising their own event in its place. We can't even find out where this tradition started, or why.

"With the advent of self-driving vehicles, the unavoidable will become clear: people are terrible drivers, and operating your own car is unacceptably reckless if a better alternative exists.  I see the coming timeline like this: (copied from a reply to another post)  

&gt;2-5 years: The last major technological hurdles (driving in rural/poorly documented areas, driving in adverse conditions, cost) are resolved. Cars are now demonstratively better drivers than humans in all situations. (note: may be a very liberal estimate.)  
4-6 years: The first round of legal cases involving driverless cars is settled, producing a precedent that makes driving your own car very risky. A collision between two vehicles, one self driving the other not, almost always results in fault to the driver. Causing an accident while operating a car with unused self-driving capability makes drivers extremely vulnerable to being sued.  
5-10 years: Safety studies, overwhelmingly favorable to self-driving cars, lead to the option becoming mandatory on all new vehicles. insurance companies, burned by litigation, offer premium rates to those who never switch off the driverless option, while increasing rates on drivers who elect to operate their cars manually. Soon the difference between these rates becomes enormous.  
10-15 years: Commercial driving is entirely automated. Cabs, buses, trucks, trains, ""driver"" becomes an obsolete profession. The savings in both wages and liability is simply too tremendous to allow any non-automated fleet to remain competitive.  
15-20 years: Studies conclusively show that the only traffic casualties that still occur are exclusively due to human operator error. It becomes evident that driving your own car is unthinkably dangerous, like drunk driving at night with no headlights or seatbelts. Safety laws are passed that effectively outlaw operating your own vehicle.   
  
By the time my nephew is 15-16, controlling a car will be something that only hobbyists do, and never on public roads.  Very few cars will be privately owned, rather they will be operated by private or municipal transportation services.    
The age of the personal automobile is ending. CMV.

Because the importance of the vote is not bound to whether it has an effect on an election; it's not bound to whether the Socialist Party candidate does or doesn't get into office.

"To be honest, I'm not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement. The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. Currently, the migrant crisis is one of the biggest items of concern for Europeans. Most Europeans say, with much accuracy, that the migrant stream has to be shut off because a) immigrants are a weight on the economy, and b) most migrants refuse to assimilate, creating a lot of social problems. However, I still feel like they have to own up to that problem. Western societies historically engaged in colonialism and imperialism and profited over it so much, that they achieved wealth that continues to earn their country the status of ""developed/first-world."" Often times when they did this, they ended up creating conditions in the colonized country that would be unfavorable to their future development. I know most Europeans/Americans would respond to this by saying ""I had nothing to do with this, why should I take responsibility over the past?"" but I find that to be a really weak argument. If my grandfather robbed somebody of something, died, and passed the stolen goods/money down to me, don't I have a moral obligation to return the stolen items, even if I had nothing to do with the crime? I think I would. Maybe the main problem with my view is that it is purely moral, and not legal/practical. But letting poor people work out the problems that are partly as a result of your people's past seems very selfish to me.

However, that's not really what's going on here.

However, that's not really what's going on here.

"Uber is having a very public fight right now with NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, basically arguing that they should be allowed to compete with yellow cabs in a free market and that consumers should have a choice.  I would find this argument much more convincing if Uber weren't exempt from almost every rule and regulation by which the TLC governs traditional taxi services, on dubious legal grounds.  Yellow (and green) cabs in NYC must comply with many rules, including car safety inspections, emissions checks and other environmental regulations, and driver background checks.  Whether you agree with these rules or not (and I certainly have some questions about some of them), the fact remains that they are expensive to follow and that cost is of course passed on to the consumer by the cabs.  


Uber is not competing in a free market at all, in the sense of operating more efficiently to offer a lower price-- they're just gouging their competition by flouting the law.  If Uber (or anyone else) disagrees with these laws (such as the regulation of fares), they can of course use the political process to try to get them changed, but in that case they should be changed for regular cabs also.  There should never be a situation where there is one set of rules and regulations for regular cabs and a separate set for Uber.  


Uber is not and should not be above the law, no matter how cool and ""disruptive"" they might think they are.


**TO BE CLEAR: I am not arguing for or against any particular regulation.**  My argument is that, whatever the level of regulation you favor, Uber and yellow/green cabs should be held to the same standard.

"Ah, like it says in ""Dust In The Wind."" Every line in that song is correct except for ""nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky."" Probably won't last forever either.


I believe that it doesn't matter what you do in life. Well, not in the big scheme of things anyway. Human endeavors such as developing a cure for cancer or ending world hunger are all very noble, but futile nonetheless. Maybe we'll get there someday, but does it matter? For now it seems like it does, but when our species dies out it won't. God probably doesn't exist and nobody gives a shit. ""You create your own meaning in life"" is wishful thinking, because your ""meaning"" ultimately doesn't really matter to anyone or anything but humanity at large, if that. And if it doesn't matter, it's not meaningful.


I'd love to be wrong on this one, so go ahead and change my view.

And then they started talking about the multiverse. And how there are totally different temporal dimensions that our temporal dimension exists in and how our ""forward"" in time is ""up"" one level up or some crazy arbitrary dimension.

Like, you just sorta realize that time is **totally and completely arbitrary.** People put so much emphasis on time being such a huge thing, like if we don't last until the end of the universe in 10^gazillion millennia or whatever they calculated it to be, we don't matter, but no, it's just another arbitrary dimension, it's like saying that unless I'm really, really fat, I don't matter and I'm totally meaningless because I don't take up as much space in this dimension.

Being dependent on time is so, so arbitrary. Time is just a randomass mechanic that our minds just sorta found it convenient to interpret. I mean, everything about our universe is just interpretations. These colors are just radiation. There's radiation going directly into my eyes right now and some physical law has allowed a mysterious thing called consciousness to emerge from the soup inside my head to make what we call an image out of that. Time is like color, we're just looking at entropy and somehow, the evidence of less entropic states enters each of our consicous states in order to make memories.

My take on this is if there is a meaning out there, you wouldn't know. Meaning, as far as I can define it, is ability to have some sort of effect. I'm not sure if logic even exists outside of our universe, like I don't know if true and false are just suddenly not the only states of things outside here, but as far as I can tell, the best definition is having an effect, and when you have rigorous laws and logic, everything you do affects everything. The universe is just a structure, time included, just like a bunch of blocks you put together to make a Jenga tower that relies on every piece to stay up except Jenga is literally the opposite of that, but everyone always uses it as a metaphor for engineering so w/e. That's what Chaos theory is, if you change anything or remove anyone, suddenly the universe doesn't exist. It's gone. If someone from outside the universe came in and made you not exist, literally the ENTIRE UNIVERSE is gone. Aliens outside of our observable universe but still in our universe would just, without even knowing why, also stop existing because they rely on your existence.

That's fucking crazy, like, right now, some pregnant alien overlord is worried about their leadership and their baby and they're not worried about me at all, but if it weren't for me RIGHT FUCKING NOW being a thing, they would be freaking DEAD. They don't even KNOW.

I'm not even sure I'm trying to change your mind at this point, I started typing and then I just got really enthusiastic, but yeah, you really should realize that

"Hello CMV,

As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in comparison to other nations in categories such as [infrastructure](http://www.statista.com/statistics/264753/ranking-of-countries-according-to-the-general-quality-of-infrastructure/), [poverty rates](http://www.epi.org/publication/ib339-us-poverty-higher-safety-net-weaker/), [education](http://thelearningcurve.pearson.com/index/index-ranking), and so on. Usually, these show other nations, typically Scandinavian and other European countries, consistently coming out on top. 

This leads to a somewhat negative and unhealthy perception of America for both citizens and non-citizens that I think is unfair. This is because, in my view, there are 3 factors which hinder America's ability to keep up with its developed nation counter parts:

* Land Size
* Population
* Cultural Heterogeneity 

First, here is a top 5 list of the largest nations on Earth by square mileage, in order from largest to smallest:

* Russia
* Canada
* China
* United States
* Brazil 

The US is the 4th largest country on the planet, and as such, I think its ability to manage and update infrastructure is limited. A bullet train similar to those in Europe would be difficult in the US. Also, land from coast to coast is extremely diverse, ranging from plains, to mountains, to desert, to swamps, and so forth. Such a diverse biome requires diverse management of resources and is pretty difficult in my opinion. 

Now here's a top 5 list of countries by population, from largest to smallest:

* China
* India
* United States 
* Indonesia 
* Brazil 

Not only is America massive in terms of land area, it has a massive population as well. This high population puts financial strain on social nets, public education, and other public programs that can lead to problems. (This is not to say America *wisely* spends its money on its people, but that is a separate argument for another day). And yet compared to the other 4 most populous nations, it still maintains a high standard of living, relatively low poverty rate, and economic mobility. 

The only other country that hangs with America in *both* categories is China, which is massive in size and population. But America differs from China in one way, which is my third point -- a heterogeneous culture. 

The US was founded by immigrants, as a nation of immigrants, and diversity is only growing into the future. America features such a mixing pot of ethnicity and culture that it makes it difficult to enact programs that benefit everyone equally. I think this is most evident in education, where the US has the difficult task of creating a system that benefits *every* child in the best way possible. In China, a largely homogeneous population with high value on education *should* produce high results. 

And yet, despite having all three of these factors to consider, the United States is ranked [5th on the Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index) as late as 2014.

So, basically my argument is this -- The United States, being huge in size, huge in population, and having a heterogeneous culture, is at an instant disadvantage in comparison to other nations, and is doing pretty well for itself all things considered.

"I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in top movie list rankings. I am a westerner who has had exposure mainly to western film but also enjoys many other film types and cultures including Japanese and anime film.

However, I don't much care for Studio Ghibli stuff. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I don't like it. Except for Hisaishi's music, which I think is beautiful. I don't know why everyone seems to like these films so much. 

It bothers me as lots of my other views in life are congruent with the norm, or I can see why they vary.

I've watched lots of Ghibli films in order to give them a chance. I've already heard lots of people arguing that the artwork is great (and I do agree it is) and that's what makes the film great, but that doesn't cut it for me; the same people who argue in this way don't seem to apply that logic to the other films they watch and so must be adapting their viewing style for Ghibli or just repeating something they heard somewhere else, not responding as they normally would (perhaps with reference to direction, plot, acting, action, scripting, etc) when asked why they like a film.

Any comments or thoughts (outside of 'the artwork is so good') would be appreciated.","Ghibli films convey a feeling of sublime **wonder** unlike any other art or medium I have ever experienced. A large part of this is exploring the connection between humans and the environment/the world around them through the plot, themes and motifs, and *gorgeous* art.

In *Spirited Away* this is largely by incorporating spectacularly creative and colorful elements of Japanese Shinto mythology and fantastic scenes and characters. The landscapes and settings portrayed include a touch of steampunk, ""the bizarre"" reminiscent of Lewis Carroll and Alice in Wonderland, and scenes of intense tranquility. As the film follows Chihiro, we get to see some of the most brilliant scenes of both traveling and growing up. 

*Princess Mononoke* also presents the Shinto religious motifs and mixes them with the conflict of modernization and human industry/technology/feudalism - portraying environmental themes with a fantasy flair. The incredible strength of character displayed by Ashitaka, Eboshi, and San help carry this film, there is wonder and marvel at their badassness. Ashitaka is a beast.

*Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind* was an early pioneer of the apocalyptic wasteland setting. I hate bugs, but the way that the film portrayed the bugs in the movie was so endearing, startlingly innocent, and compassionate it is the only thing that has ever made me feel strongly emotional about bugs. It paints a bleak and haunting beautiful picture about war and devastation and survival in a wasteland all at the same time.

*Kiki's Delivery Service* is another slice of life with picturesque scenes and a touch of magic/witchcraft. The sense of wonder comes via scenes of flight whether by broom, dirigible, bird, or a ill-conceived propeller bike - flying over the charming scenes of urban life while following Kiki's journey of growing up in a new city.

In *My Neighbor Totoro*, the wonder is strongly tied to slice of life and compelling family themes.

Studio Ghibli films are breathtakingly gorgeous, crafted for appreciation by children and adults, incorporate serious and meaningful themes, expertly portray the bildungsroman/coming-of-age story/character growth for both male and female protagonists alike, and conduct a sense of wonder in a way that no other piece of art or literature is able to do.","I'm unaware of many people who rate movies based on specific criteria outside of movie critics themselves. And even then, most are willing to accept that a movie can be a gestalt, a sum greater than its parts. And even then, critics also accept the visual and spectacle of a movie as being part of whether it's good. Your analysis (or expectation of how someone else would analyze a movie) is almost all technical, which does not speak to the quality of a movie and how it can actually affect people.

So, here are a few things usually part of why Ghibili movies are considered great which also apply to western movies.

1. Visuals. Especially in an era of nearly-realistic CGI, the sheer awe of a visually stunning movie are part of what make it good. When people put Jurassic Park on their lists of best movies, it is in part because of how gorgeous the visuals were. And how that creates the important sense of wonder that drives the rest of the film. See also Gravity. Or the Lord of the Rings, which was lauded in large part for looking the way that movie should look.

2. Characterization. None of the characters are evil for the sake of evil, or lack convictions which are (at the very least) understandable. The Noh isn't malicious, just misunderstood. Now think about how often bad action movies are slammed for lacking good characterization beyond ""gritty tough hero"" and ""bad guy for no apparent reason."" That scarecrow from Howl's moving castle has more characterization without *speaking* than Tony Stark has gotten in five movies.

3. Cohesive, character-driven, plots. Benefits of having good characters is that the plots are not macguffin-driven or rely on happenstance or sins of convenience for resolution. 

4. Acting. Yep, even animated characters can act. First, they're damned expressive as characters. Second, the voice acting is top-notch.

5. Stories, both relatable to the audience and unique. Yes, it takes a bit of suspension of disbelief to believe in the world of Spirited Away, but not much more than the suspension of disbelief for the Avengers. And once that's taken care of, the story itself is relatable. A young child who irresponsibly acts, and needs to fix it? That's old-school Spielberg at his best. A man who has acted selfishly is confronted with the need to consider others (and love) and risks himself to protect others? Yes, some of them are silly, but the ones people consider among the best movies are ones which resonate.

6. Emotional impact. This comes from the characters being fleshed out and relatable, but there are none but the most hard-hearted who don't tear up at the goddamned scarecrow in Howl's moving castle. That's a more significant emotional impact *without* having to resort to ham-handed tear-jerking.",447,"Ghibli films convey a feeling of sublime **wonder** unlike any other art or medium I have ever experienced. A large part of this is exploring the connection between humans and the environment/the world around them through the plot, themes and motifs, and *gorgeous* art.

In *Spirited Away* this is largely by incorporating spectacularly creative and colorful elements of Japanese Shinto mythology and fantastic scenes and characters. The landscapes and settings portrayed include a touch of steampunk, ""the bizarre"" reminiscent of Lewis Carroll and Alice in Wonderland, and scenes of intense tranquility. As the film follows Chihiro, we get to see some of the most brilliant scenes of both traveling and growing up. 

*Princess Mononoke* also presents the Shinto religious motifs and mixes them with the conflict of modernization and human industry/technology/feudalism - portraying environmental themes with a fantasy flair. The incredible strength of character displayed by Ashitaka, Eboshi, and San help carry this film, there is wonder and marvel at their badassness. Ashitaka is a beast.

*Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind* was an early pioneer of the apocalyptic wasteland setting. I hate bugs, but the way that the film portrayed the bugs in the movie was so endearing, startlingly innocent, and compassionate it is the only thing that has ever made me feel strongly emotional about bugs. It paints a bleak and haunting beautiful picture about war and devastation and survival in a wasteland all at the same time.

*Kiki's Delivery Service* is another slice of life with picturesque scenes and a touch of magic/witchcraft. The sense of wonder comes via scenes of flight whether by broom, dirigible, bird, or a ill-conceived propeller bike - flying over the charming scenes of urban life while following Kiki's journey of growing up in a new city.

"I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that information triggers victims, and therefore the information ends up at ends. This includes language such as ""Pepper spray can deter attackers of any kind, and therefore it is strongly recommended that ANYBODY carries it with them at all times."" or ""Hot zones for crime include times after dusk and before dawn, so it is advised to travel in groups at this time to deter attackers.""

People rage at this information saying that I should not ask anything of the victim, and that this information is useless. People often use the argument ""We should teach people NOT TO RAPE""

My issue here is that the suppression of this information in lieu of pursuing an idealistic rape-free culture neglects the current standing of our surroundings, and that dangerous people still exist, and will exist for the foreseeable future. I see no harm in telling anyone that safety is important, and that there are very cogent steps to significantly lower your risk of being attacked and/or raped.

The only instance I would excuse my previous statement would be people telling actual victims of rape what they COULD have done. This does nothing to change what happened, and is a slimey thing to do.

Maybe this is just an Anti-SJW rant that I didn't even know I was making, or maybe I have an actual argument here. If I am not clear on this classic argument, I would appreciate some clarity, and am always open to thoughtful and courteous discussion.

Please no flaming, arguing, or fighting. Thank you!

Many people have this misconception that rapes only happen to attractive and sexy dressed women in dark alleys. This is a cliche conveyed by Hollywood.

Rape doesn't necessarily comes from strangers, and it also doesn't only happen to women who dress up sexy. Many rapists do it more because of  domination/power/humiliation reasons than because the victim is visually attractive to them.

This means that when you start of the path of victim blaming, there is simply no limit because there is no point where women will be safe. It starts with asking people to dress differently and hang out in safe places, and it ends up with asking women to stay at home and cover themselves entirely.

Second thing is: women are *already* taking precautions, and they do NOT need a guide to know what to do. What they don't want is for the medias to present the rape situation as something women are partly responsible of. 

There are already too many people who still don't admit that rape is rape in some situations... and you want to perpetuate the idea that this is true?

In other words, remove the incentive for the creation of such content.

"Disclaimer: this talk of secession may not be present everywhere in the United States, but it is more than prevalent where I live, so I'm going off that.  


To me, secession is crazy talk.  Not only are Southern states often some of the most poor (the poorest being Mississippi), but the United States would have control of the entire military of the United States of America.  That's, well, a lot. 

I talked to someone who believed the South should secede and that ""we"" (the South) would win because ""now [the South] has all the guns and more than half of the major military bases"".  To address this, first of all, it's not as if the military suffers from a chronic lack of arms.  The United States, I'm sure, has ways of attaining weapons that it doesn't already have.  Second of all, it doesn't matter if you have half the major military bases.  First of all, define ""major"".  Second of all, the other side would still have half of them, AND a higher population, AND more money, AND probably the support of many foreign nations (because who would want to side with the South, who would seem like backwoods racists).  The South would crumble, just as it did in the 1860's.  CMV.  ","There are nukes in the south. No two nuclear nations have ever declared war on each other. If the South seceded and acquired the ability to use the nukes located in the South, there would not be a war.

Now, politically, it might balkanize and collapse as the Soviets did way back in the 20th century, but if (and probably only if) it acquired nuclear capabilities, the US south would probably be recognized as its own nation, unlike the Confederacy.","The south has half of the major *army* bases, but those are the most mobile and would move if there were tensions.  Air &amp; Naval bases are distributed more evenly, and the nukes are largely in the mountains in the West.  The rest of the country wins by a rather large margin on technical and logistical support.  The South might have a lot of small arms, but it most certainly doesn't have the rest of the country outgunned with the weapons that matter.

But so what?  I think it's a little bit silly to suggest that succession would be met with a bloody all out war again.  We're largely beyond that era.  I'd suspect we, they, and the UN would lean more towards a political division.

"Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out.  
  
Vietnam was essentially a communist state, due to influences from China and USSR, which were alliances (the former is debatable) of Vietnam during the war. After the war, our country has suffered multiple economic depressions, and famines due to the incompetence of our liberally named Communist Party. Granted the South Vietnam government wasn't any better, but what the U.S wanted for Vietnam was for the best.  
  
I understand that, technically the US did not wage war with our people, but stood against the spread of communism in Asia, and with our strategic location, a battle surely followed. The US did not deliberately invaded our country. And look at what they did to the world. ~~Defeated the Nazis and fascist countries~~, uplifted South Korea, Japan (which were both smaller and less resourceful than my country) to their respectable position on the world map today. And what had the sole communist party in my country done? Nothing but left our people in the struggle of a third-world country. And China is still brazenly harassing our borders and seas to this very day, just because our army is incapable of standing up for themselves.  
  
~~Please tell me if I was wrong and why the North won was a good idea.~~  
  
Edit: My view has changed. It was not simple as I thought it was. Generally it can be summarized into those points: involvement of China, motives and war crimes committed by the US, and there was no hope in the governing system. Communism has not helped our people a bit, but no one can really advocates for America either. We as a nation should look to develop our own path. Insights are still very much appreciated. And thanks for the discussions.","I mean, I know a lot of Vietnamese-Americans who were refugees from South Vietnam who probably would have preferred the other side winning. So I don't think you're alone, but I think perhaps you're assuming that had the American backed South won, these problems would be fixed. I know you said the North was corrupt, but the South was every bit as corrupt. They probably wouldn't have been able to support the economy any better, and depressions and famine may have ensued anyway, albeit they may get support from the US. Remember that a significant number of Vietcong in the South were southerners who were disillusioned with the corruption of the government. So they in effect fueled quite a lot of backlash against themselves. I'd also point out that the government was rather unstable, as seen in the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem. If there was that much turnover, there could potentially be wars in the future over other rival factions or even communist resurgence or a probable and continual insurgency. So there's a significant potential that more Vietnamese would die in the coming years than the already horrible toll paid. Also, if the DRVN won the war, I highly doubt they'd be able to solve the border dispute between Vietnam and China considering those countries have been at odds for centuries if I'm not mistaken. My point here is that unfortunately the choice between a good government and a bad government appears to have been an illusion, and while unfortunately the current government isn't good, I guess you might say it's ""the devil you know"", considering things could have gone worse.","1) Do you know how brutal, corrupt, and undemocratic South Vietnam is? Ngô Đình Diệm isn't democratically elected, instead he was assumed the presidency by the American to a country largely make up by the remnant of French imperialism (a puppet state). He's also not popular either, remember Vietnam supposed to be unified in 1954 after Điện Biên Phủ, and supposed to hold democratic election in 1956 as a result of the Geneva Accord... Guess who would have won that if it is actually held? That's right, Hồ Chí Minh had the overwhelming support of the nation. Not because he is a communist/socialist figure, but rather a NATIONALIST one

Back to the period of Diem's rule, the government is largely consist of his family members holding key positions (gia dình tr). Also, there are huge oppression toward the Bhuddism commnunity, led to the self-immolation of some certain Bhuddist monk that you should know. Also, there were many wrongful incarceration/execution of people who are suspected to be Communists or spy from the North. Likewise, villagers are force to move into camps/fortresses to avert any uprising... These policies causing lots of oppositions from the people and thus Diem was murdered.. What happened after that was a two-year spans of political instability, and the country couldn't even control itself... Hence, the Americans forces had to involve, which coincide with Nguyen Van Thieu's rule (and he's merely a puppet in a gov't whose policies were largely dictated by the Americans)...

My point is that how could a government that unstable could actually controlled Vietnam. Lacking of integrity from the interior and strength to cope with outside forces... The result of the War largely reflects the nature of South Vietnam, a mere puppet state which shouldn't be there at first place 

2) You think that the American wanted the best for us? Well, do you understand the nature of the Cold War, a global-scale tension which Vietnam was reluctantly dragged into. Most Vietnamese couldn't associated their War within the Cold War concept, virtually because we're from the ""hottest"" spot, which overshadowed the Cold War itself. My point is the US had their own interest to stop the power of the USSR, thus they called ""spread of Communism"", and they went radical about it. Many democratic elected  socialist leaders were overthrow by the US army and replaced by anti-communism despot, most notably in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) or [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat). (Different circumstance but don't forget [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung-hee)). Vietnam War shared the same nature with these but much more intensify because of the [Domino Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory)

3) About OP &amp; Vietnam: ~~You're part of the bandwagon who want to gaze war with China to demand the islands back. How ignorance you are!~~ This is not XII century when you could easily declare war upon one another. If we do attack China, not will we suffer their reprimand, but will receive criticism around the world. Diplomacy is the key, stronger collaboration between ASEAN and the US forces would keep the Chinese in the current place.

 ""Học lịch sử chưa đâu vào đâu thì đừng lên mạng rồi chém gió..."" - Thân :))",451,"I mean, I know a lot of Vietnamese-Americans who were refugees from South Vietnam who probably would have preferred the other side winning. So I don't think you're alone, but I think perhaps you're assuming that had the American backed South won, these problems would be fixed. I know you said the North was corrupt, but the South was every bit as corrupt. They probably wouldn't have been able to support the economy any better, and depressions and famine may have ensued anyway, albeit they may get support from the US. Remember that a significant number of Vietcong in the South were southerners who were disillusioned with the corruption of the government. So they in effect fueled quite a lot of backlash against themselves. I'd also point out that the government was rather unstable, as seen in the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem. If there was that much turnover, there could potentially be wars in the future over other rival factions or even communist resurgence or a probable and continual insurgency. So there's a significant potential that more Vietnamese would die in the coming years than the already horrible toll paid. Also, if the DRVN won the war, I highly doubt they'd be able to solve the border dispute between Vietnam and China considering those countries have been at odds for centuries if I'm not mistaken. My point here is that unfortunately the choice between a good government and a bad government appears to have been an illusion, and while unfortunately the current government isn't good, I guess you might say it's ""the devil you know"", considering things could have gone worse.","1) Do you know how brutal, corrupt, and undemocratic South Vietnam is? Ngô Đình Diệm isn't democratically elected, instead he was assumed the presidency by the American to a country largely make up by the remnant of French imperialism (a puppet state). He's also not popular either, remember Vietnam supposed to be unified in 1954 after Điện Biên Phủ, and supposed to hold democratic election in 1956 as a result of the Geneva Accord... Guess who would have won that if it is actually held? That's right, Hồ Chí Minh had the overwhelming support of the nation. Not because he is a communist/socialist figure, but rather a NATIONALIST one

Back to the period of Diem's rule, the government is largely consist of his family members holding key positions (gia dình tr). Also, there are huge oppression toward the Bhuddism commnunity, led to the self-immolation of some certain Bhuddist monk that you should know. Also, there were many wrongful incarceration/execution of people who are suspected to be Communists or spy from the North. Likewise, villagers are force to move into camps/fortresses to avert any uprising... These policies causing lots of oppositions from the people and thus Diem was murdered.. What happened after that was a two-year spans of political instability, and the country couldn't even control itself... Hence, the Americans forces had to involve, which coincide with Nguyen Van Thieu's rule (and he's merely a puppet in a gov't whose policies were largely dictated by the Americans)...

My point is that how could a government that unstable could actually controlled Vietnam. Lacking of integrity from the interior and strength to cope with outside forces... The result of the War largely reflects the nature of South Vietnam, a mere puppet state which shouldn't be there at first place 

2) You think that the American wanted the best for us? Well, do you understand the nature of the Cold War, a global-scale tension which Vietnam was reluctantly dragged into. Most Vietnamese couldn't associated their War within the Cold War concept, virtually because we're from the ""hottest"" spot, which overshadowed the Cold War itself. My point is the US had their own interest to stop the power of the USSR, thus they called ""spread of Communism"", and they went radical about it. Many democratic elected  socialist leaders were overthrow by the US army and replaced by anti-communism despot, most notably in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) or [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat). (Different circumstance but don't forget [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung-hee)). Vietnam War shared the same nature with these but much more intensify because of the [Domino Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory)

3) About OP &amp; Vietnam: ~~You're part of the bandwagon who want to gaze war with China to demand the islands back. How ignorance you are!~~ This is not XII century when you could easily declare war upon one another. If we do attack China, not will we suffer their reprimand, but will receive criticism around the world. Diplomacy is the key, stronger collaboration between ASEAN and the US forces would keep the Chinese in the current place.

"I think the real reason people punish others for transgressions is not so much to discourage the behavior, but rather to channel humanity's inherently predatory nature in a way that's socially acceptable and does not contradict with the moral values we have invented (or discovered, depending on how you look at it).

Most people feel a smug sense of satisfaction if they hear about a bully being beat up, or a murderer being executed by the state. Humans, being predatory creatures, have a certain sense of bloodlust and channeling this predatory instinct towards people who are predatory allows them to continue to view themselves as not being predators, while still enjoying violence.

Even bullies often justify their torments of victims as a form of punishment for not fitting the social norms, being ""annoying"" or acting in a way that is in their eyes unacceptable. Serial killers also often see their acts as a sort of punishment towards humanity. Rapists are often motivated by a desire to punish women. It seems like evil deeds are often motivated by a perverted sense of justice rather than mere selfishness or greed.

Another reason I think punishment has more to do with humans enjoying violence than it does with stopping bad behavior is the fact that corporal punishment of children is still very popular and defended by the majority of adults. I always felt like my parents took pleasure in punishing me, so I may be biased, but I really do think parents spank their children more out of anger and frustration than out of a will to help them develop.

Another reason I think it's innate is because the moral goodness of punishment is something virtually everybody agrees on. Liberals and conservatives alike usually have a ""tough on crime"" stance and would rather a violent criminal receive a harsh punishment even if it's more expensive and makes them less likely to be rehabilitated, than a lesser punishment that rehabilitated them more effectively. This sentiment is prevalent in every culture, even in societies like Scandinavia where the laws are more lenient.

We punish people because we perceive them as ""deserving it"" ie, we despise them and lust for their blood because we perceive them as being no longer part of the same species, and something that needs to be predated upon for the benefit of the community.

I actually think if there was no prison or capital punishment it would have very little effect on crime rates. The few people who are truly serial offenders could just be put in hospitals and the rest will eventually be released from prison anyway and will be far crazier on release after spending decades in the pen.

In a nutshell, I think punishment has actually caused far more evil than it's prevented and is really just an outlet for our inherent cruelty as a meat-eating species at the top of the food chain. Punishing people we consider ""bad"" also has the effect of affirming our own self righteousness.

"Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a pedantic point. Please don't let it dissuade you from answering. Also, the title should read: ""there is no *consistent* moral framework"". The mere existence of a framework is not a very interesting point to debate.

A few things first: I do eat meat, and I don't want have sex with animals. I believe both eating meat and having sex with animals are wrong. I think that the reason that I eat meat despite believing it is wrong is that it's simply what I've been doing my whole life.

Okay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry.

Consider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: http://www.wikihow.com/Collect-Semen-from-a-Bull-for-a-Breeding-Soundness-Exam

How can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus?

I don't see a justification for either behavior on 'natural' grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally (that is to say, not artificially) there are plenty of things which occur naturally (rape, infanticide, kidnapping) that we all agree are immoral.

After giving out three deltas, I think my view on the question as I posed it has been changed. I think if I could go back in time I would probably have said ""CMV: If it is immoral to have sex with animals, then it is immoral to eat them"" but as far as the existence of consistent moral frameworks justifying one of the behaviours but not the other, I am thoroughly convinced.

What's typically thought to be wrong about meat-eating is the suffering inflicted upon animals as part of industrial farming. If we were to reform our practices around meat-eating, however, and do away with these objectionable conditions, it's possible to to satisfy your first condition, to hold that eating meat is permissible.

For the second, we just need to hold, quite reasonably, that animals have rights against being harmed and that non-consensual sex is a harm. Both of these are pretty straightforward given how we view the torture of animals and rape.

I suppose what puzzles you is the apparent tension between saying ""it's OK to kill an animal and eat it"" and ""but animals have rights against being harmed."" This tension can be resolved if death turns out not to be a harm for the one who dies. Now this is actually a fairly tenable view. Consider some paradigmatic cases of harm: you break your leg, you're robbed, or you're psychologically abused. Something every case of harm seems to have in common is that the harm involves a comparison your state of being before and after the harming event. So when you break your leg you're worse off than you were before breaking your leg in virtue of the pain and hindered motion that you experience. If you're robbed you're worse off than you were before the robbing in virtue of being deprived of whatever was stolen. If you're psychologically abused, then you're worse off in virtue of the change in your mental well-being. So harm involves a comparison between how you were before the harming event and how you were after it. Given this comment element it's reasonable to define harm in comperative terms. So something like ""S is harmed by event X if and only if S is made worse off than they were with X having happened.""

Now when we try to conceive of death as a harm we run into a problem. Namely, there is no ""you after death"" to compare to. So before death you were x, y, and z, but after death you are non-existent. Since there's nothing to compare to, we can't count death as a harm on the comparative account that I gave above. Perhaps there's some other way to make sense of death as a harm for the one who has died or perhaps death is only bad for people who cared about the deceased and have had their own interests frustrated by her death. I'm not going to come down on either side of this debate here, but the latter is at least a reasonable approach to take and if it's correct then we can coherently say of animals that it's OK to kill them, but not OK to harm them.

Does that make sense?","Under the moral framework of rational self-interest, objectivism, virtue-value ethics, or Aristotelian ethics eating meat of animals is good because it gives us sustenance, and the *means* are justified as we have rights over beings that don't have the potential for free will or rational thought. Beastiality (as with rape or sex with a tree) is bad because it is an act that is self destructive i.e. self demeaning to the perpetrator (an act of destroying your own integrity).

"I have come to this conclusion for several reasons.
*The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience alone it is the country most likely to use them again.

*The main positive effect of atomic weapons, that gets brought up a lot , is mutually assured destruction. The USA dropped 2 atomic bombs, not as retribution to an atomic attack. It demonstrated a lower bar for considering using them.

*The USA regularly starts new wars. It's certainly the nation among the big superpowers that is most likely to initiate a new war and, in the case of Irak, can not even explain why they went to war in the first place. A country that is this likely to be involved in wars is more likely to find itself in a position where it would consider using another atomic bomb.

"Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001)  It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to *five years in prison.*  Under the current law, it is a very serious felony to make any materially false statement to any federal agent.

This law is routinely abused by the government to give them leverage over defendants.  [Ken White at Popehat describes how:](http://popehat.com/2011/12/01/reminder-oh-wont-you-please-shut-up/)

&gt;Here's how it works. The feds identify some fact that they can prove. It need not be inherently incriminating; it might be whether you were at a particular meeting, or whether you talked to someone about the existence of the investigation. They determine that they have irrefutable proof of this fact. Then, when they interview you, they ask you a question about the fact, hoping that you will lie. Often they employ professional questioning tactics to make it more likely you will lie — for instance, by phrasing the question or employing a tone of voice to make the fact sound sinister. You — having already been foolhardy enough to talk to them without a lawyer — obligingly lie about this fact. Then, even though there was never any question about the fact, even though your lie did not deter the federal government for a microsecond, they have you nailed for a false statement to a government agent in violation of 18 USC 1001. To be a crime under Section 1001, a statement must be material — but the federal courts have generally supported the government's position that the question is not whether a false statement actually did influence the government, but whether it was the sort of false statement that could have influenced the government.

&gt;Hence, the government's chickenshit false statement trap works — even though the government agents set it up from the start. Now, however weak or strong their evidence is of the issue they are investigating, they've got you on a Section 1001 charge — a federal felony. In effect, they are manufacturing felonies in the course of investigations.

I think there should be no crime here unless it can be proven that the falsehood actually impeded an investigation in a meaningful manner.  Also, I think the penalty should be much less severe, more like a misdemeanor.

What I found is a large body of case law annotating § 1001 and reversing convictions for lack of materiality.  Upon a reading of these cases I do not believe that your example here: 

&gt; They ask questions which they know the answers to, can prove are lies, **and which the only purpose of asking is to get a 1001 charge.**

particularly because of the bolded portion, would support a conviction.  In other words, I believe the materiality requirement is taken quite seriously by the courts and acts as a safeguard which in most cases would prevent the abuse you are concerned about.  

There are an awful lot of cases dealing with this issue, published and unpublished, but here are a few quotes I thought most relevant and concise:

&gt; [T]he purpose of the materiality requirement of section 1001 is to exclude trivial falsehoods from the purview of the statute, since false statements that lack the capacity to influence a determination required to be made [by the agency] are too trivial to violate the statute.

*United States v. Wheeler*, 247 Fed. Appx. 558, 560 (5th Cir. 2007)

&gt; From the statutory history, it is evident that section 1001 was not intended to reach all false statements made to governmental agencies and departments, but only those false statements that might support fraudulent claims against the Government, or that might pervert or corrupt the authorized functions of those agencies to whom the statements were made. Typical of the kind of statements that are within the purview of section 1001 are false reports of crime made to federal law enforcement agencies that may engender groundless federal investigations.  The statute was not intended to embrace oral, unsworn statements, unrelated to any claim of the declarant to a privilege from the United States or to a claim against the United States, given in response to inquiries initiated by a federal agency or department, except, perhaps, where such a statement will substantially impair the basic functions entrusted by law to that agency.

*United States v. Bedore*, 455 F.2d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir. 1972)

&gt; Deciding whether a statement is ""material"" requires the determination of at least two subsidiary questions of purely historical fact: (a) ""what statement was made?"" and (b) ""what decision was the agency trying to make?""

*United States v. Gaudin*, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (U.S. 1995)

So if the FBI is asking you a question ""which the only purpose of asking is to get a 1001 charge,"" then a false response could not be material.  The state would need to prove that they were required to make some determination (in the case of the FBI, the resolution of a criminal investigation), that they asked you something in furtherance of the investigation, and that you knowingly gave a false response calculated to deceive them in a manner that would influence the outcome of the investigation.

Lots of legalese in there but I'm happy to discuss or post more!","IANAL but I think this is already included in the law. The law makes a misrepresentation of a **material** fact illegal. This means that the prosecutor has to demonstrate that the statement was false and that the false statement mattered to the investigation in a meaningful way. 

So I don't think lying to the FBI is a crime in the case where the lie does not matter. ",455,"So, I looked into this on Lexis with a quick search because your question is an interesting one!  What I found is a large body of case law annotating § 1001 and reversing convictions for lack of materiality.  Upon a reading of these cases I do not believe that your example here: 

&gt; They ask questions which they know the answers to, can prove are lies, **and which the only purpose of asking is to get a 1001 charge.**

particularly because of the bolded portion, would support a conviction.  In other words, I believe the materiality requirement is taken quite seriously by the courts and acts as a safeguard which in most cases would prevent the abuse you are concerned about.  

There are an awful lot of cases dealing with this issue, published and unpublished, but here are a few quotes I thought most relevant and concise:

&gt; [T]he purpose of the materiality requirement of section 1001 is to exclude trivial falsehoods from the purview of the statute, since false statements that lack the capacity to influence a determination required to be made [by the agency] are too trivial to violate the statute.

*United States v. Wheeler*, 247 Fed. Appx. 558, 560 (5th Cir. 2007)

&gt; From the statutory history, it is evident that section 1001 was not intended to reach all false statements made to governmental agencies and departments, but only those false statements that might support fraudulent claims against the Government, or that might pervert or corrupt the authorized functions of those agencies to whom the statements were made. Typical of the kind of statements that are within the purview of section 1001 are false reports of crime made to federal law enforcement agencies that may engender groundless federal investigations.  The statute was not intended to embrace oral, unsworn statements, unrelated to any claim of the declarant to a privilege from the United States or to a claim against the United States, given in response to inquiries initiated by a federal agency or department, except, perhaps, where such a statement will substantially impair the basic functions entrusted by law to that agency.

*United States v. Bedore*, 455 F.2d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir. 1972)

&gt; Deciding whether a statement is ""material"" requires the determination of at least two subsidiary questions of purely historical fact: (a) ""what statement was made?"" and (b) ""what decision was the agency trying to make?""

*United States v. Gaudin*, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (U.S. 1995)

So if the FBI is asking you a question ""which the only purpose of asking is to get a 1001 charge,"" then a false response could not be material.  The state would need to prove that they were required to make some determination (in the case of the FBI, the resolution of a criminal investigation), that they asked you something in furtherance of the investigation, and that you knowingly gave a false response calculated to deceive them in a manner that would influence the outcome of the investigation.

"To my knowledge there are no peer reviewed sources that link GMOs to any negative health effects. There is as much reason to believe genes manipulated in a lab are inherently harmful as there is for genes selected through domestication. I am asking for a CMV because I have not done thorough research other than reading a few articles supporting my view including a recent cover story for Nat. Geo, a magazine I highly respect. However as a scientifically-minded person, I can't ignore the massive movement against GMOs without considering it first.","Also a fair point to make. Not all people who are Anti-GMO's have concerns because of negative health effects. 

There are also potential environmental concerns, concerns about increasing monocroping, shady business practices (may or may no be unfounded), potential lax government oversight on safety (GMO's have only been around since 1980, whereas vaccines in early 1900. Take that as you will). Additionally while GMO developers will argue that they are needed to be able to feed a growing population, the much larger problem is food transportation. So much food already gets thrown away. 

Also a fair point to make. You know you are getting a Vaccine, and know the ingredients that are in it. You don't always know you are eating a GMO, even if you wanted to know. 
","I disagree. I do not think overall that GMO's are bad, but I don't think GMO's are unequivocally good. 

GEMO's - much like any other technology have their share of risks. Why - specific vaccines have their own share of risks. 

Recently there was a controversy with the vaccine Pandemrix

It was linked to increased risk of narcolepsy, and then those conclusions were withdrawn in one journal. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemrix#Narcolepsy_investigations_in_the_European_Union

The reason why I bring up this isn't that there is a direct parallel - but I want to ask 

&gt;""What would a rational person believe when they haven't yet formed a belief""

This is predicated on many things including our biases and our perceptions of risk. 

Making decisions on perceptions of risk is a rational decision I would argue. 

This is very difficult with vaccines. If there was a pending investigation with Pandemrix questioning it's safety as a vaccine - what do you do? What do you do when there's a swine flu outbreak and you have to choose whether to get a potentially risky vaccine or run the risk of getting a disease. 

Imagine a person in a similar position with respect to GMO foods. 

There is no ""upside"" to ingesting GMO foods like there is with vaccines. By avoiding vaccines - we run the risk of not only acquiring certain diseases, but also putting the public at large at risk. Vaccines are generally safe, and my concern for potential side effects doesn't outweigh my concern for safety from diseases and my concern for others. 

However, if I was to make a stand against consuming GMO foods - I do not have to make that stand against a greater threat. 

Yes - it is possible that in some places, the ONLY way to grow crops is GMO, and some people claim that only through GMO can we achieve food security (a claim I am highly skeptical about) and so my not wanting to consume GMO does have negative repercussions. 

However - for most people, there appears to be no such concern. 

To be clear - I am not particularly concerned about degradation of my health while consuming GMO, but I want to illustrate that it is a rational decision to oppose GMO. 

I also disagree with the premise that GMO is ""basically the same"" as regular crops. The methods of production (edit: added production and ""and"") and what can be achieved through GMOs are very, very different. You could never have a kickstarter for glowing plants 

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/antonyevans/glowing-plants-natural-lighting-with-no-electricit

if you were growing plants traditionally, and even if it were possible - would likely be infeasible. 

Of course - some people have problems with the commercial practices of companies, and are concerned about things like IP issues and a lack of diversity. 

So in conclusion, I think most opposition to GMOs is unfounded, but there are rational reasons for individuals to not want to consume/support it.

"Apologies in advance, as I'm sure this topic has been done to death in light of recent events. I read a few of the posts and they really didn't do anything to help my confusion. Viscerally, I feel like the two **are** different things and should be treated as such, but every argument I'm seeing seems to fall flat for me and I'm left with the default position: the two are functionally equivalent.

The primary argument I've read against my view is that there are biological differences between how men and women are wired mentally. However, most of the papers I've read on the matter are based on [population studies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763413003011) that tease out group differences from large and varying datasets. Brains aren't monolithic things that are all one way or another - for that matter, new neuronal connections and pathways can be influenced by surroundings, behavior and a host of other factors. If [where you live can determine whether or not you develop schizophrenia](http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/795.full.pdf&amp;), then it's quite possible that growing up with black siblings can subtely affect the brain connections of a white girl from Montana. Stepping back though, why should empirically-observable differences 'legitimize' obvious differences in behavior? Our understanding of brain physiology is nowhere near precise enough to give us a 1:1 correlation between behaviors and biochemistry, and even if it were, it's not clear to me at all that someone's behavior should be invalidated because it doesn't map to our limited biological understanding.

Another argument I read differentiated gender as an individualistic identity and ethnicity as a group identity. I like the thought, but just like brains, black identity isn't a monolithic thing. For every Rachel Dolezal - there are likely thousands of non-black people living in predominantly black neighborhoods, developing identities not terribly different from the black people they most often interact with - your Eminems, to use a terrible example. Saying lack of pigment invalidates that identity seems functionally identical to saying lack of a particular sex-characteristic invalidates a gender identity.

Feel free to point me to a discussion, if you don't want to rehash this. I'm pretty open to having my mind changed on this one, as my feelings seem to be in disagreement with my reasoning.

"I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any meaning in calling life ""free"" then one should freely be able to leave at their discretion.

Raising the rails could be argued for as a preventative measure for someone throwing someone else off the bridge, but that's not what I'm interested in. Should it be raised as a preventative for suicide.

I don't think suicide is as much of a problem as we think. ""People shouldn't commit suicide"" - this belief stems from Middle Age christian era and seems to have been passed on from generation to generation. I don't have any scientific knowledge, in fact I don't think there can even be any scientific knowledge that can imply a reasoning such as this. It seems to me to be an idea that could be true and also may not be true.

Further, who am I to judge that someone else's life with someone else's perspective that it is always wrong to kill oneself? Surely even with a simple cost-benefit analysis it can sometimes be ok.

I still understand the sadness that arises when someone does it, but it's not because they've done it, it's because of where they must've been to want to do it.

Sure, I'll admit that raising them may prevent a few cases, but someone that is intent on doing will still climb over it. But I don't know for sure that it will, there's no evidence to my knowledge that supports this. Then there's also the side that raising the bars will make the initial altitude higher and increase the acceleration of the falling person increasing the likelihood of death from the impact.

For those who don't want to change my mind, I'm interested in hearing your arguments that support my opinion also.

Thanks!

"* As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss.

* I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the ""warm glow"" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. 
* Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture. Because of climate change, and the overuse of farmlands we may reach that point in the near future.

Should we not spend money researching vaccines and coming up with any sort of cure? Because if you necessitate the treatment of diseases or chronic illness to the old and not the young, it kind of undermines the whole point of making an equitable and healthy society anyway.

Here's some perspective: I was born with a terrible amount of allergies. I was a kid who missed plenty of school days and even became hospitalized over the respiratory infections as a result of my allergies. After many attempts at finding the cause, eliminating the allergen, doctors found an effective treatment for me.

Now, by your logic, one of those times I was in the hospital, it would have been wise to just give up. The cause of my illness and the severity to which it affected my life couldn't be easily identified. But luckily, science and medicine kept steadily chugging along and they were able to identify the source of my condition (a rare and newly discovered thing) which has led to me living a full and vibrant life. 

Rethink what you believe you really *know* in this viewpoint and you may realize that a lot of your key components are conditional and change on a case by case basis.","At least in the USA, the government is a democracy, in which all people should have a say. The government should therefore mirror all its peoples' interests. The group for chronically ill does exist, so is it not fair that they at least receive some recognition in government? If people have an interest in having government-subsidized chronic disease healthcare then the government should at least somewhat represent those people.

When one observes the art and literature left behind from the Black Death, one can see that the people were suffering. Grotesque images of the infected as well as hysteria over what caused the disease ran rampant. The misery of the general public could not be understated, as a force outside their control killed their loved ones without discretion. If such a kind of suffering was to happen, and people knew exactly who was to blame, is it not reasonable to conclude that deaths of chronically ill which affected people would cause the affected to conduct civil unrest?

The argument that GDP will increase is somewhat flawed by itself. The government has actually produced something known as a stimulus check to boost consumer spending in times of recession. Taxdollars which go through the government would still increase the country's GDP because the government still spends money on subsidizing chronic medication. If the proposed system of removing government funding was introduced, then that same money would instead go directly to charities and thereby go to health expenditure. The GDP would remain the same because the government no longer is allowed to tax for chronic illness in the proposed system. The government would still keep the same amount of usable revenue because of an equal decrease in expenditures and an equal decrease in revenue.

In addition to this, chronic illness can range from ~~mile~~ mild to immediate death upon removal of medication. Those people who have chronic asthma aren't really burdening society, but their malady can still be classified as chronic. How does one draw the line between that and something more severe, like crohn's disease? Some people who would otherwise be happily be living would be killed in the name of euthanization. If the government was to apply this same principle to other minority groups, the government might as well kill all seniors over 80 years of age.

Because if you necessitate the treatment of diseases or chronic illness to the old and not the young, it kind of undermines the whole point of making an equitable and healthy society anyway.

Here's some perspective: I was born with a terrible amount of allergies. I was a kid who missed plenty of school days and even became hospitalized over the respiratory infections as a result of my allergies. After many attempts at finding the cause, eliminating the allergen, doctors found an effective treatment for me.

Now, by your logic, one of those times I was in the hospital, it would have been wise to just give up. The cause of my illness and the severity to which it affected my life couldn't be easily identified. But luckily, science and medicine kept steadily chugging along and they were able to identify the source of my condition (a rare and newly discovered thing) which has led to me living a full and vibrant life.

"I don't have an incredibly detailed post on the matter.  My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote, they will most likely be too lazy to take the time to read up on their candidates or what they're voting for.  I believe everybody should have the right to vote and access to voting, but when you're cajoling people into registering you're adding fluff votes based on color, party, or sensationalized issues.
I feel like most people I've brought this up with believe I'm wrong so I just want a well constructed argument as to why.  Not here to argue at all, thanks for your time!

"Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can.

However, recently, many of my friends have been attempting to convince me that by my own utilitarian views, neither veganism nor vegetarianism are the most moral choice, and in fact, a gluttonous amount of meat is the best for environmental, ethical, and health reasons.

So far, I've been able to counter most of the evidence offered to me either with my own evidence from trusted sources or by pointing out the lack of merit from the sources given to me (lots of comic sans blogs).

This is something I do honestly believe that, given enough evidence, I would change my view on, and it seems like a lot of people seem to think they have evidence that a diet of meat is better in some way that I might consider meaningful, and of the many that do, there's bound to be some that might actually have something worth considering, so please change my view. :)

EDIT: I should say that I'm posting this from an American viewpoint in which most of our factory farms typically don't treat animals very well. If you live in a country in which the animals are treated with respect and then eaten, that might be a different story, but that is not the situation that I am in. Please try to consider this in addressing my CMV and presenting your evidence however your discretion guides you.

"First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from an objective point of view. This post was inspired by a question I posted to /r/legaladvice and was told that it's a douche move. I didn't feel it was appropriate to discuss the douchiness of it there so I decided to make this post.

You go into a parking lot and are trying to find a place to park. There's one 15 spots away from the door and then there's one that's 3 spots away from the door. One of them is meant for expectant mothers but there is no punishment for parking there if you are not an expectant mother which makes the two spots equivalent in everything expect for distance from the door. Objectively, it's better to choose the closer one.

"This is purely from anecdotal, self researched and experiential  knowledge, so feel free to correct me if there are any glaring issues in my position. I believe that some of the social welfare programs in the United States could be reformed to give jobs, education, and training to low-to-none income individuals and families as opposed to handing out checks. I believe that this would be beneficial because:

1. Living off a free welfare check sometimes decreases an individual's drive to work and better themselves; and by extension to increase their standard of living

2. Providing job training and/or an education to underprivileged individuals allows for the betterment of the individual - increasing ambition, social ability, financial stability, and other benefits

3. Providing job training and/or an education to underprivileged individuals allows for the betterment of the society - increasing the education of American society as a whole, decreasing unemployment and crime rates

4. I believe that there is enough money (read: safety net programs budget in the US; http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-where-do-our-federal-tax-dollars-go) that will be freed up in order to allow this reform

It's a tautology. The reason we have safety net programs is because we want the right people in the right jobs.

The types of jobs that publicize position vacancies to programs that focus on job placement are usually minimum wage and temp positions, bottom of the barrel type jobs where the employer isn't concerned so much with finding the right person for the position as a body to fill a hole.

If an accomplished accountant has a really unfortunate layoff when his company goes belly up, and can't find a comparable job for some time, it makes a hell of a lot more sense to give him a little cash to hold him over until he does find an equivalent position than to place him in meal assembly at Burger King where his skills will be completely wasted. 

Also, if safety net programs were defunded to provide for job placement and education programs, what would the really unfortunate people who don't have a cent to there name do to feed and house themselves and their families while attending daily classes or waiting for job placement?","There's a perception that you can live ""comfortably"" on welfare, which would naturally decrease someone's drive to work.  It's really not true.  The welfare state as it exists now makes it incredibly difficult to live a satisfying life without a source of income.

I'll give you an example.  Let's say you're a single person who is unable to work consistently because of a mental illness; not something that totally cripples you and makes you unable to leave the house every day, but something that causes you to suffer months-long bouts of depression or anxiety that make holding down a long-term job or building a career impossible.  Your resume is really bad because you've tried and failed to hold down a job for several years, which means it's hard for you to find work outside of a place like WalMart that will hire anyone with a pulse.

So, you apply for ""welfare.""  It varies a bit based on where you are, but what you can expect to get if you apply for the whole package is:  
- Food stamps, on the order of about $100 a month that can only be spent on unprepared food  
- Housing assistance, which means cheaper rent (not no rent) if you agree to live in a neighborhood where people get robbed and assaulted on a regular basis and everyone is selling drugs  
- Medical insurance, which will make your doctor's visits free but which will refuse to cover most non-generic prescriptions (remember, you're dealing with a mental illness that could kill you if you aren't medicated)  
- Cash assistance, which is exceedingly difficult to qualify for and can go as high as $200 in some states, but averages more like $85.  Usually these require that you're on SSI to get.  

You're disabled, so you can also apply for Social Security Disability Insurance, right?  Well, you can, but you'll get denied.  You have to pay a certain amount into Social Security to qualify for the disability insurance, and if you've been mentally ill since you were a teenager there's no way you've held down a job that long.  What you qualify for is SSI.  SSI tops out at roughly $750 a month, and they will reduce that dollar for dollar with any unearned income you get, like if, say, your parents are allowing you to live rent free or buying you the occasional fridge full of groceries.  If you do manage to temporarily find work, that amount will be reduced by fifty cents for every dollar you earn, after a couple of small deductions.

Add on to this that every single one of these programs is separate.  There is no monolithic ""welfare.""  These guys, and the food shelf, and any charity you work with will all want records and updates and details on your life.  If you do decide to make a try of un-fucking your life and get work, you will have to obtain and send out a half-dozen copies of your pay stubs to a half-dozen different offices, and a three-paycheck month or a single bonus check can devastate you.  These benefits take months to apply for, and if you lose them because you made too much money in one thirty-day period or saved up more than two grand (which can easily be wiped out by a single car repair bill) it can take as much as 90 days to get your benefits back.  During that time your already low income is cut.  You're eating one meal a day, you're letting your bills pile up, you're calling in favors and borrowing money from people who are already sick of you asking them for things.

There are people who may deserve a scholarship more, based on achievement, but cannot have the chance to even try.

I'm sure that there must be a reason for this (as that's why I'm here today in the first place) but I can't find any reasoning that I can justify for such exclusion.

Either they discriminate on merit or they discriminate based on race/gender. Many schools use scholarships to promote diversity, but not necessarily just racial diversity. They know that they can't get every applicant they accept to enroll in the school, so a lot of schools will pad their ""yield"" (percentage of students accepted who enroll) by offering generous merit scholarships to top students. In the same way, if a school wants to help improve its perception with regards to diversity or race relations or social justice, it's using scholarships to incentivize students with particular traits to enroll.

The scholarships that are designed for people who are not purely academic achievers were never meant for those students anyway. They wouldn't exist without the school needing to create a diverse environment. Colleges can't exist without the student bodies that make them up. Many colleges just hand out their scholarships to help mold their incoming class into the perfect blend (in their eyes).","So (and please don't take this the wrong way, as it's coming from a recipient of a ""diversity scholarship""), I would wager to say that out of every 100 total scholarships that are available, about 20 have restrictions about who can apply (maybe that number is higher, I'm not sure, let's say 20). Being a white male, you are statistically more likely to be in the front running for those 80 other scholarships. This is not your fault, as you didn't choose to be a white male, but the 20 people who are in the front running for the other scholarships didn't choose that either, and I'm sure if the system was fair, they would be advocating for the elimination of special requirement scholarships, but the fact of the matter is the system isn't fair. 

Let's take a look at the inner-city public high school system for a moment. These schools are woefully underfunded, woefully underserved, and (generally speaking) are largely minority based. Chances are the students who attend said high school will not be afforded the privileges of those who attend a more well-to-do high school in the suburbs (eg SAT/ACT prep courses, AP classes, etc.), thus making them (potentially) less likely to have the requirements necessary for certain scholarships. This is not the fault of the student, it is the fault of a broken system.

Long story short, I suppose, people from traditionally more privileged heritages (eg: white males) are more likely to obtain the criteria necessary for scholarships, based purely on the failings of the public school system, and that is why race and gender based scholarships apply. Because those students who get race based scholarships prove to be just as successful at the college level, but perhaps wouldn't get the chance if not for scholarships geared towards them.",464,"So (and please don't take this the wrong way, as it's coming from a recipient of a ""diversity scholarship""), I would wager to say that out of every 100 total scholarships that are available, about 20 have restrictions about who can apply (maybe that number is higher, I'm not sure, let's say 20). Being a white male, you are statistically more likely to be in the front running for those 80 other scholarships. This is not your fault, as you didn't choose to be a white male, but the 20 people who are in the front running for the other scholarships didn't choose that either, and I'm sure if the system was fair, they would be advocating for the elimination of special requirement scholarships, but the fact of the matter is the system isn't fair.

Either they discriminate on merit or they discriminate based on race/gender. Many schools use scholarships to promote diversity, but not necessarily just racial diversity. They know that they can't get every applicant they accept to enroll in the school, so a lot of schools will pad their ""yield"" (percentage of students accepted who enroll) by offering generous merit scholarships to top students. In the same way, if a school wants to help improve its perception with regards to diversity or race relations or social justice, it's using scholarships to incentivize students with particular traits to enroll.

The scholarships that are designed for people who are not purely academic achievers were never meant for those students anyway. They wouldn't exist without the school needing to create a diverse environment. Colleges can't exist without the student bodies that make them up. Many colleges just hand out their scholarships to help mold their incoming class into the perfect blend (in their eyes).",r2,0.7,0.6,0.8,0.6,0.9,0.0,0.8,0.7,0.9,0.0,0.6,0.7,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.4,r1,,
"Im probably going to ramble on and such so i will make my point clear from the way i see it. Also my rhetoric is not going to be nice because its sort of half a rant too. I guess this is directed at a sort of liberal/progressive crowd, but can apply to right wing people too.

Ever since atheism and anti-theism movement sprung up on reddit we have been bashing it. Some of those reasons was correct. I believe atheists used too much rhetoric such as ""free thinker"", ""skeptic"", ""reason"" and ""logic"" to push their agenda. And we used to (USED TO) have neckbeards spewing some obnoxious shit. And i agree they come off as cringy. But in general, mockery of religion is fun, really fun and FAIR! We laugh at bullshit ideas all the time.

""im an atheist but please be tolerant, let them believe"" or ""People believe different things"" or something similar.

-We have such an agenda of tolerating christians because in the west because the majority is still christian, this also influences ""tolerant atheists"" subconsciously

-We tolerate Islam because ""that is the religion those people in them middle east believe in"" so it would make us racist to criticize it. Like i get it Fox news is racist, but i dont have to be racist because i critizice Islam. Its like the people who try to tolerate Islam somehow think its racist to criticize it, failing to see that there is a diverse spectrum of people who believe in Islam and not just middle eastern people. Calling people racist for critizicing Islam is such a high level of mental gymnastics that i cant even. 

-We cant critizice Jews because that would make us literally Hitler. (I actually understand this one though)

-Mormons are made fun of, but mostly they get the same treatment as christians ""let people believe what they believe"".

-We dont respect the views of other-kin, astrologists, parapsychologists, flat earthers etc.

Because?

They are not a majority, nor taught to us before we could write. That is what i think most people choose to ignore. We dont have people spewing tolerance of religion because we have some genuine need to spare someones feelings. Its because christianity is popular, based on faslehood and people feel like their beliefs are under attack.

When was the last time you saw someone going out of their way to defend a person who claimed to be a wolf? Oh, wait they get laughed at and mocked universally. Guy claims to believe hes literally drinking the blood of christ? Someone mocks him and gets labeled a fedora neckbeard.

Like seriously if someone tells you they believe in unicorns you can probably laugh in their face like ""HAHAHA, you believe that?"" and no one would bat an eye. However, have long debates where you try to go into detail of the problems surrounding religion and trying to debunk it? Richard Dawkins and speakers like him get called intolerant. As if a desire to uphold truth is somehow wrong because people get their little feelings hurt.

The way i see it religion is as fake as astrology or unicorns. But there is no one defending the latter. Religion is bullshit with good PR. I would prefer to keep laughing at people who think they are wolfs, but with a world where no one is trying to pretend like religion needs some sort of handicap from society to not ""hurt precious feelings"". I should be able to find religion absurd without being labeled ""Euphoric"" or ""fedora wearing neckbeard"". 

I wish we could call out bad ideas no matter how many people believed in it. I want eqaulity when it comes to mocking things. The way i see it now religion has some sort of taboo of criticism that is protecting it. The way i want our society to change its view is  for people to watch all three videos  below and laugh. Just for the sake of equality. Sincerely, i live in Norway so i recieve minimal damage from religion. I just wish religion did not have to have some protective shield and having it be taboo to criticize it because they will cry the loudest when mocked.

People mocking stupid beliefs:

-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtH7l-dhHZQ [1]

-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlMiKrwCRQ0 [2]

-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea6w3zp-dYY [3]

Penn Jillette: Why Tolerance Is Condescending

-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpNRw7snmGM [4]

What would change my mind is either:

-A huge amount of people going out of their way to prevent people from critizicing bullshit ideas such as Astrology, para-psychology etc. (people can believe what they want, tolerance, does not hurt you)

-A huge appeal to mock christianity from its own communities.

-Some source proving society not having a total hypocritical view of what bullshit ideas we are aloud to mock and not

"Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out.  
  
Vietnam was essentially a communist state, due to influences from China and USSR, which were alliances (the former is debatable) of Vietnam during the war. After the war, our country has suffered multiple economic depressions, and famines due to the incompetence of our liberally named Communist Party. Granted the South Vietnam government wasn't any better, but what the U.S wanted for Vietnam was for the best.  
  
I understand that, technically the US did not wage war with our people, but stood against the spread of communism in Asia, and with our strategic location, a battle surely followed. The US did not deliberately invaded our country. And look at what they did to the world. ~~Defeated the Nazis and fascist countries~~, uplifted South Korea, Japan (which were both smaller and less resourceful than my country) to their respectable position on the world map today. And what had the sole communist party in my country done? Nothing but left our people in the struggle of a third-world country. And China is still brazenly harassing our borders and seas to this very day, just because our army is incapable of standing up for themselves.  
  
~~Please tell me if I was wrong and why the North won was a good idea.~~  
  
Edit: My view has changed. It was not simple as I thought it was. Generally it can be summarized into those points: involvement of China, motives and war crimes committed by the US, and there was no hope in the governing system. Communism has not helped our people a bit, but no one can really advocates for America either. We as a nation should look to develop our own path. Insights are still very much appreciated. And thanks for the discussions.","The North winning is by far the best scenario for the vietnam war. 

The reason for this is because you fail to factor in China. China was ballsy enough to invade an independent Vietnam that was allied with the USSR after the war. You would be crazy to think that they would allow a territoy close to their South to fall to another enemy. 

If the South started winning and legitimately invaded the North, China would most likely allow North Vietnam's leadership to die off and they would install their own leaders and probably destroy the South. I see no reason they wouldnt do this and America would be insane to intervene. The Vietnam war had relatively low casualties for the US side(even so there were protests around the US with millions of people yelling for peace), increasing that by a factor of 10 for a third world country would not do. So basically a Chinese Vietnam which would probably look like North Korea/khmer Rouge.

And in the impossible scenario where the South wins with No Chinese/Soviet intervention then Vietnam would be the same/worse. It was horribly corrupt under the South leadership(main reason so many southerners supported the North, mainly farmers but still). When the people are united and dont see ideologies as enemies but instead their fellow citizens that oppress them. Then there will be more war. This Vietnam would most likely follow the path of Iraq.

The last scenario is the US intervenes. I will not add nukes(also it's boring) because it is MAD in that scenario because both China and US had nukes. China stomps the US out of Southeast Asia easily. American public wouldnt have the stomach to lose 300k+ soldiers for an impossible war. If the US intervenes anyway then they lose hundreds of thousands of soldiers and experience an economic fall the likes of which it has never seen before. The Soviet Union has a field day and expands elsewhere like Philippines/Indonesia/Africa with almost 0 intervention. ","I have nothing but admiration for the Vietnamese people. Within a span of 30 years the French were expelled, the United States was stopped from partitioning or exerting control over the country, and shortly thereafter a Chinese invasion was repelled. The Vietnamese also deposed the Khmer Rogue in Cambodia, a regime responsible for massacring millions of people.

Understandably, you look to countries that have done well out of being within the US sphere of influence, like South Korea. Remember though that the Rhee regime, which was supported by the US during the Korean war, was also responsible for massacring 100's of thousands of civilians. At the time, alignment with the great power that would exert the least influence over Vietnam (the Soviet Union) was likely the best option.

You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that mainly talk about how the other party/candidate would be bad for this country, the ads I have a problem with are **endorsed** by a political party that used taxpayer money to attack another political party. I think that to use taxpayer to further your own agenda is wrong.

I think that instead of using money to fund public dialogues that they can put on public networks, this would allow them to talk about what problems they have with other parties with the the other parties having the ability to respond and rebuttle if they have proof that they are wrong. 

I am also not that smart so I would love to hear any problems with my logic! CMV reddit

As I understand it your view is based on *negative* attack ads used by political parties, but not all ads used by the political parties are attack ads, or negative. (But please realize that negative is a loose term, even an ad that says something bad about another party's policy is ""negative"" even if it does it in a neutral tone. There's a specific term for that: acceptable negative.) Most ads tell us the priorities of competing parties and the differences in their policy platforms. They serve a very useful function: To provide voters with information in a simple manner that is easily recalled. Points made in debates are not easily recalled since they get lost in the back-and-forth.



Even negative ads serve a very useful function. They may be ugly, but they're often full of information regarding a political party's position on a policy or a candidate's weaknesses. They are actually scrutinized to a much higher level than positive ads and actually serve an important purpose in getting the public to engage with issues.



Negative ads are based on policy over personality in a 4:1 ratio, so the media's mania over the overinfluence of negative ads is overblown. In fact, as you can see from the second source I provided Canadians do not react favourably towards personal attack ads and all parties are wary of crossing a line and losing votes as a result. Some negativity is to be expected, but Canadians are pretty nice about it all.

Plus, there's the simple fact than one party (CPC) is the best at fundraising --probably because it's the only major right-of-centre party-- and it uses that money to produce ads b/w elections, when there's no restriction on spending. By banning attack ads, you're penalizing the other parties from being able to defend themselves from attacks b/w elections. Please take a close look at table 7.2 in the first source I've provided - the disparities in spending are shocking.


But what about your alternative of more debates? Is it really a good idea to have a LOT of debates and no ads? I don't think so. I watched the recent Maclean's Leaders Debate and while I enjoyed the debate, I was appalled at the post-debate analysis. The talking heads were discussing which *zinger* really hit home and how it would affect that leader's image. There was another section --the most awful one, in my opinion-- that had a ""[body language expert](https://youtu.be/hSf2__qpeGA?t=2h44m24s)"" analyze the body language of each of the candidates and draw conclusions on their personality **and** policy. It was AWFUL! If the television media actually cared about reporting on policy, I'd be with you for all debates all the time. But they boil it down to a competition among leaders that's part of the problem. The media's focus remains on ""the process of politics rather than its substance.""

I hope this changes your view.

"It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. However, to make a group, each member has to have something in common, other than just being human. It could be gender, race, a common vision or belief. You get the idea.

So by uniting based on common characteristics, we automatically exclude those who don't fit the mould. Thus creating every kind of discrimination you can think of.

The worst part is, if you look at groups of people looking to reduce discrimination, they're as much as part of the problem as the original perpetrators. One example of this in action is the reporter who was kicked out of a Black Lives event in CSU. African Americans have a long history of mistreatment in the US and many have the right to be furious. But the problem is that they see all ""whites"" as being the perpetrators of this mistreatment and exacerbate the ""white vs black"" dichotomy. 

My opinion on how to solve these issues is this: I've been told that to solve problems as a couple, you mustn't make it ""you"" vs ""partner"", you have to make it ""both of you as a couple"" vs ""the problem"". So I think we should apply the same logic to racism and sexism. Women vs men and whites vs blacks (only two of the uncountable amount of dichotomies that exist) can't be solved by separating and pointing fingers at the other group, it can only be solved by uniting. There is no Us vs Them, only Us.

Perhaps you've suffered discrimination first hand (as I have) and disagree with my opinion because you want justice above all. In which case, please explain your opinion.

Edit: Sorry if I reply late, having a bit of a family emergency. ","I think you're overlooking the fact that most of the progress that we've made so far (racism, sexism, etc.) has been because members of both groups have united against the problem. For example, when women finally achieved the right to vote it wasn't simply because all women wanted to vote, while all men didn't want this; members of both groups united and tackled the problem.

But there's always blowback because not everyone wants to join, not everyone is as progressive as you think they are. Your view is (slightly) naive because it doesn't take into account that there are those people who accept (an out of balance) status quo and are willing to defend it. A simple example on Reddit is TRP. Feminists welcome men and women to work for the equality of women, but this doesn't go down too well with everyone so there are counter-movements.

This sounds great on the surface, but fails horribly in practice. Most racism and sexism happens subconsciously. A white man is going to want to hire other white men. It's not that he's racist; it's just that we like people that are like us. Unless you point out this behavior and make him conscious of it, it will continue on forever.

Likewise, a police department may arrest black people at a higher proportion than white people. It's not that they are racist, but the arrest records show that black people are more likely to be criminals; a connection is made in your mind.

"Donald Trump is a decent businessman who inherited his capital. He's a punchline. A rich punchline, but a punchline all the same.

His views on immigration would not only alienate the countries south and north of the border, essentially saying they can't be trusted not to ""send"" their criminals here, but it would make us look paranoid to the rest of the world. People can come to the U.S. as tourists from several countries, not just Mexico, completely legally. They then can slip into the sea of people and stay, illegally. The problem with illegal immigration is much more complex than he seems to realize.

The man has no foreign policy experience. Boardroom deals with businessmen and bureaucrats from another country does not equate to nation-to-nation diplomacy.

His national defense ideas that I've heard seem to amount to, ""more guns and let's tell other countries to screw off.""

The Democrats' stance that the rich want to influence policy to get richer does not exclude Donald Trump. Who is to say he wouldn't endorse policies that would make it easier for both him and his kids to double their fortune?

"This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in.  I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained.  

My wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country.  I will reflect on my mother’s story.  She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country.  When she came to this country she was on government assistance.  With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master’s Degree.  Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community.  I don’t need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent’s generation, their hard work and sacrifice.  

I hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country.  I’ve read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings.  However I don’t completely buy into it.  I’ve seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education.  As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I’ll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do.   At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint.  As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings.  They had no problems acting 'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america.  That is why I don’t have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty.  I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story.  If there are books or articles which provides a cogent counter argument please feel free to share.    

TL:DR – The rationale for why blacks and Hispanics are unsuccessful in the U.S. are bunk because of the success of Asian Immigrants.  

Edit: This is not to say that there isn't racism in society, especially towards Asians.  Colleges definitely try to make it harder for Asians to get admitted despite higher scores, and there is a Bamboo Ceiling in the workplace.  However, I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.  

Edit2: I appreciate the dialogue.  One point which I'll concede and am swayed from the dialogue is that racism, more specifically the historic racism perpetrated in the U.S. such as Jim Crow and Slavery created the culture which is present in the poor black community, hindering them from rising from poverty.  But nothing disputes that this culture is reason, and not the present-day racism that is preventing them from achieving in this country.  That is what I have issue against that the media portrays a image of victimization due to current day racism, however, I don't think the type of racism is the cause, maybe past racism, but not the type minorities face today.  If no one has a counter argument against the cultural aspect, shouldn't black culture, the one that glamorizes the baller lifestyle, be the focused of policy makers to change rather than focusing their efforts on social restructuring to accomodate the culture?  

Edit3: At the end of the day, and the dialogue set forth I come away from it with the following:

1) That current poor black culture  is a result of systemic discrimination.  
2) No one has disputed that culture which I have generally claimed is the REASON for the state of poor black americans.  
3) The present day racism and white privilege that exists today is not sufficient enough to either hold a demographic down or lift them up, not as much as the modern day media seem to claim.   
4) I want to beef up on some books and articles cited
5) The IQ debate. hmmm I'm just not going to touch that right now.  
","&gt; I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.

In case of blacks, isn't that sort of begging the question of where that culture *came from*? 

Even if for latinos, you would subscribe for a theory about their countries' catholicism being weaker than protestant work ethic, that would be one thing. 

But how do you argue, that if you kidnap millions of people, keep them as cattle  for generations, forbid them to learn literacy, and break apart their families at will, then for another century, regularly lynch them, force them to live in specific districts, and occasionally firebomb the most successful of those districts, then the resulting ghetto culture somehow won't be primarily and obviously shaped by racism? ","I think the blacks rights thing plays a big issue in this. It really hasn't been that long since that period and the racism from that still persist for a period of time after changes in laws.  In part the effects of that and the slavery thing is still ingrained in their culture. 

For the Latino population, many are illegal immigrants, which really affects their earning potential. Then their families also tend to be bigger too which means more money needed to support. Teen pregnancy rates were also higher for them which hinders them too. 

Asians are lucky with not as strong discrimination and oppression.  I know there is racism, but it's not nearly the same as the other two population.

"I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in top movie list rankings. I am a westerner who has had exposure mainly to western film but also enjoys many other film types and cultures including Japanese and anime film.

However, I don't much care for Studio Ghibli stuff. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I don't like it. Except for Hisaishi's music, which I think is beautiful. I don't know why everyone seems to like these films so much. 

It bothers me as lots of my other views in life are congruent with the norm, or I can see why they vary.

I've watched lots of Ghibli films in order to give them a chance. I've already heard lots of people arguing that the artwork is great (and I do agree it is) and that's what makes the film great, but that doesn't cut it for me; the same people who argue in this way don't seem to apply that logic to the other films they watch and so must be adapting their viewing style for Ghibli or just repeating something they heard somewhere else, not responding as they normally would (perhaps with reference to direction, plot, acting, action, scripting, etc) when asked why they like a film.

Any comments or thoughts (outside of 'the artwork is so good') would be appreciated.","_Spirited Away_ contains one of the most hauntingly beautiful scenes I've ever encountered in a movie, one that resonates deeply with me.

I once spent six months of my life travelling, alone, in countries where I was either marginally fluent, barely able to speak a few hundred words, or completely incapable of communicating in the local language (depending on the country). 

That scene where Sen is on the train, riding through the water with no-face following her? That *perfectly* captured the surreal experience of being alone and unable to communicate in an alien land.

It's moments like that that make Ghibli awesome. Not the art work; not the story per se (although _Princess Mononoke_ is an amazing story): the fleeting momentary encapsulation of feeling in the form of art. ","This type of CMV is pointless. Nobody is going to be able to convince you to be retroactively moved by a film.

However, I can assure you that nobody is ""faking"" their love for these movies, as you suggest. Why the hell would people do that?

I once spent six months of my life travelling, alone, in countries where I was either marginally fluent, barely able to speak a few hundred words, or completely incapable of communicating in the local language (depending on the country). 

That scene where Sen is on the train, riding through the water with no-face following her? That *perfectly* captured the surreal experience of being alone and unable to communicate in an alien land.

It's moments like that that make Ghibli awesome. Not the art work; not the story per se (although _Princess Mononoke_ is an amazing story): the fleeting momentary encapsulation of feeling in the form of art. ","This type of CMV is pointless. Nobody is going to be able to convince you to be retroactively moved by a film.

"A few points clarifying my view:

* By primary language, I mean either *official* language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that country (i.e. English in America)

* I don't expect fluency. My mother has lived in Canada for almost twenty years now and she still has trouble sometimes. My view is that all immigrants should strive for at the very least an [intermediate](http://www.londonschool.com/level-scale/) mastery. 

* My one exception would be if an immigrant does not have the financial capability to pay for lessons in the language of the country they've moved to. However, in Canada at least, free English lessons are offered to new immigrants, so I wouldn't see any reason to not learn the language here. 

Not learning the primary language of the country they've moved to encourages segregation and often leads to racial or cultural tension. By refusing to learn the primary language to an acceptable extent, they're showing a blatant refusal to adapt even a little to their new country's culture. Even if you're living in an area where you could live your entire life speaking your mother tongue, it doesn't make sense to not at least do the bare minimum to adapt. What's the point of coming all the way to another country if you're not going to respect it? Multiculturalism is wonderful and should be valued, but refusing to learn the country's language and creating enclaves is *preventing* multiculturalism.

First of all,  for the past 200 years, older people immigrating have very often kept their original language.

Now, virtually all of their children became fluent English speakers.  And many of these are the most ""patriotic"" (whatever that means) people, who no doubt respect their country.

Today, in Minnesota, we have groups of Somali and Hmong where all of the kids (at least those who have been here a while) are fluent in English, but the older community members still speak their native language.

Now, of course the first ones to come need to learn the language, because they don't yet have a community.  But the rest tend to go where there are others already like them.

Why add the burden of learning a new language (which is difficult at an older age)?  Their kids will know it, and can help them when translations are needed.

I grew up among immigrant communities in Queens, NYC and worked a decent amount providing social services to immigrants.

The immigrants that you're talking about, that don't learn English, generally don't move to America because they love American culture and want multiculturalism. They do it for practical and survival-oriented reasons. They keep their heads down and work hard and try to make money so that they can help their children have a less crappy life, or so that they can send money to their impoverished families. Or, they flee here because shit is godawful in their home country and they just want to mind their own business and live with a modicum of stability and do better.

So they work long hours 6 days a week in entry-level shitty paying jobs in restaurants or nail salons or driving cabs. They are often financially exploited.

If you ask if they want to learn English, many of them will say yes. They may insist that their children learn English and worry that their kids won't speak perfect English.

"While I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems.

I believe that we will never be satisfied with what we have, there will never be equality for all, we'll continue to destroy the environment and in the end, we will all die a much worse death trying to live happily than one that would come form purposefully erasing our existence. Looking at it from another perspective, it's like eradicating the parts of DNA needed to make tonsils so that humans never again deal with tonsillitis. In that analogy, the human body would be the Earth and tonsils would be the people. Tonsillitis would be the possibility of people doing bad things and removing the DNA would be what we do to get rid of humans. I just think that, not taking feelings into account and going with the quickest and simplest option, remove the problems from the root is ideal. Once again, this does not take into account feelings of people as obviously most of us don't want to die, regardless if it would be better for the planet.

Of course, erasing humans from the planet is much simpler than you'd expect. It also doesn't have to be prolonged or painful as would be our deaths from a polluted world and from wars. I am sure that within 50 years, a group could easily genetically engineer a strain of virus to get the job done. Mass production of asbestos and coordinated release all over the world could work too. What I'm saying is that it's pretty easy and could be done quickly. Nothing more, nothing less.

Now, this is all assuming a few things:

- That if humanity continues, we will eventually cease to exist against our will.
- That humanity will never have true equality.
- That war will always continue in some form.
- That we will continue polluting/degrading the Earth as long as we exist.

If each human somehow became the ""God"" of their own universe (though I have no idea how that would come about) then I believe there would be no problem with each individual existence, as controlling your own universe means that no matter what you do you are in the right. Of course, that is all BS/fiction and we live just like all the animals on the Earth, aside from being special in our own little ways. I don't think we as a whole can ever fully agree on anything, and that our disagreements will always cause us problems.

Once again, I believe the destruction of the entire human population to be our best solution.

As an aside, some other animal may eventually evolve to be intelligent in the manner we are, so the possibility of simply destroying all life to forever end suffering of any kind on this planet is considered.

"This one seems so obvious to me but I'll provide the basic points:

It is a person's right to do whatever they want with their own body so long as doing so does not infringe on the rights of others.

Prostitution is, presumably, an agreement among consenting adults. I'm not trying to defend anything other than exactly this.

There is virtually no immediate difference between prostitution and pornography. Simply adding a camera with the intention of creating porn somehow makes the act legal. 

The reason it is so alarming is that it is a blatant violation of our rights to our own bodies. It's the government tacitly saying they are the ultimate authority as to who we have sex with and under what circumstances it is permitted.

Most importantly, since people will do it anyway, making it illegal forces it underground (just like drugs). In the places where it is legal it can be heavily restricted in ways that prevent disease and the rights of the workers can be protected. 



Since I don't think I've ever heard a single decent argument against this, I'm interested in having this deeply held belief challenged.

Edit: I'm having a hard time responding to everybody but I really appreciate everyone's input. My perspective on this issue has increased immensely even if my position hasn't really changed. I no longer think it's ""alarming"" that the US hasn't shifted it's consensus to my way of thinking.

1) Legalizing prostitution might have a negative affect on poor women (or men, let's keep this gender neutral). With such a readily available income source, people who are struggling to pay the bills might become prostitutes instead of pursuing their actual goals. Similarly to how children in developing countries could be ""forced"" into child labor if it is legal, people can be economically ""forced"" into prostitution. I believe people should have a right to their own body etc, but when economics are involved, it becomes a little fuzzy. For example, we do not allow people to sell body organs, because those who are desperate for money would feel compelled to.

2) Prostitution is far harder to regulate than you seem to think, and it's tough to protect men or women who are putting themselves in a vulnerable situation where they are alone with a ""customer"". Sexual assault and other forms of violence are not uncommon in these situations.","I feel it's safe to assume that if legalization occurs, prevalence of prostitution will increase, as there won't be any repercussions legally.

Prostitution is a profession that takes a huge mental toll on the people doing the job. 47% of prostitutes need treatment for abuse of alcohol and drugs. 70% of women in prostitution in San Fransisco have been raped on the job. A study in Portland, Oregon, found that prostitutes were raped on average once a week. 85% of women in Minneapolis were raped. 94% of women involved in street prostitution have been sexually assaulted. 

Let's check the Netherlands, a nice country where prostitution is **legal**. 70% of women (prostitutes) experienced verbal threats of assault, 60% actually suffered physical assault, 40% experienced sexual violence and 40% were forced or pressured into the profession. PTSD rates are between 45 and 84%. From 5 countries, researches found that 2/3 of prostitutes have PTSD.

If one were to take away the having sex with strangers for money aspect, any profession that boasts such rates of PTSD and sexual assault, etc. isn't anything that any government would want its citizens partaking in, especially as it isn't necessary for society to function. Your parents when you were a kid probably didn't want you going out and smoking crack cocaine, so they probably told you ""you can't do that"".

"I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small town/village, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too many to list, but the big ones are:

#Cities have significantly better municipal services.

The difference is night and day. Cities have bigger and better libraries, schools, police/fire departments, hospitals, gas, internet, and so on and so forth. As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first. Everything about this makes city life so much safer and more comfortable.

#Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.

A really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops. Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties. There are theatres and large public events and strip clubs and meetings of like-minded people and clubs and just about anything to do if you ever get bored. There's a convenience store on just about every corner.

#Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity.

If you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a **new neighbor** that they wanna get to know and everything. Even if you abstain from social interaction, you become ""that weird neighbor that abstains from social interaction."" This  tends to temper individualism, and it's not like you can ""just spend time with the people you like,"" because rumors and all travel fast with a community that small.

#bugs

holy fucking shit the bugs aaaaaaaaa

#In the country, everything is high maintenance.

Since just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.","&gt; If you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a new neighbor that they wanna get to know and everything.

This isn't necessarily something everyone finds nice about the city. Some people really enjoy moving into a small community and getting to know their neighbors, and some people feel isolated, small, and alone with the ""pseudo-anonymity"" that comes with living in an apartment complex in the middle of the city.  It really depends who's talking. For some, city life is better in this respect, but for others, it's not.

&gt; Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.

Depends what you're looking for. If all you want to do is go hiking on the weekends and tend your garden at home, the city won't be what you're looking for.

"I definitely realize a lot of harm can come from poor examples of cultural appropriation. Often my idea of bad appropriation was the Christianizing of many pagan holidays/traditions by the church to get the pagans of europe joining up with them. 

But my particular case seems a lot different. Yes I am a dominant race type (being white) and I am seriously considering getting a tattoo based upon textiles and patterns used by the Incan Civilization during their peak. Specifically, it would be a sleeve only representing the vibrant colors and geometry that the Inca use. I'm getting it for a few reasons:

* Aesthetically it is very pleasing to me

* I hold a lot of respect for what their civilization accomplished, and would like to ""advertise"" them more through body art

* I may possibly incorporate their symbols for the sun, their main focus of focus worship. Although nonreligious myself, I respect that worshiping the material sun and nature around us is an important trait more of us should take note of. 

This still seems to be textbook cultural appropriation, but is it immoral for me to do so? If I believed this could truly degenerate the Incan culture or offend many rational minds, then there is no way I'd go through with this plan (that just isn't the type of person I am). So, please, change my view if there is something I may be missing here.

For example, white suburban kids listening to Gansta Rap and wearing do-rags while not having ever (or will ever) experience the specific circumstances that led to those becoming relevant icons in the Black community. Or, more recently, white people wearing headdresses to music festivals (or getting them tattooed on them). Headdresses are, in many Native American cultures, a very sacred and symbolic motif used for specific practices and people. White people who wear them are choosing to ignore the negative parts of Native life and cherry-pick aesthetics. I can go more in depth but that's not the point.

You are interested in ""appropriating"" from a culture that hasn't had a lot of presence since the 16th century. Though I'm sure you could find an Incan descendent somewhere with an issue there, I doubt you will run into many of them. However, I wanted to address two points:

1. Aesthetics

This is the primary argument used by people who want to utilize symbols or costumes from other cultures. You understand this is not generally considered a way of ""honoring"" the culture, but picking pieces you think are ""pretty"" with very little regard for their weight or history? Usually, when discussing cultural appropriation in an academic string, this has no weight.

2. ""I may possibly incorporate their symbols for the sun, their main focus of focus worship. Although nonreligious myself, I respect that worshiping the material sun and nature around us is an important trait more of us should take note of.""

Let's say it wasn't the Incan culture, and it was Hindu. You admit to not being religious, but like certain aspects of their religion, which they probably take very seriously and personally. Do you see how this could be seen as trivializing, white-washing, and ""appropriating"" something that you admittedly don't follow in your own life? It's like saying ""Native Americans worship nature"". 

3. I hold a lot of respect for what their civilization accomplished, and would like to ""advertise"" them more through body art

Do you think people don't know about the Incan civilization? Or are you attempting to create solidarity between you and those of Incan descent? Sorry, I don't really understand this point. ","If you are taking the specific images from a different culture that you have no direct ties to, (Academic curiosity is not a direct tie.) you are claiming those ties. 

If, however, you are inspired by those designs and incorporate some of the aesthetics and styles into your sleeve that is different. Then you are only saying ""Hey, I like this aesthetic style"". 

Mohawks are a perfect study of this. Yes, there is a Mohawk tribe of Iroquois. But the strip of hair down the center of the head with clean shaven sides is not specific to that culture, or even common within it. It just became synonymous with that tribes name because white people choose to ignore inconvenient things like ""facts"" when creating style and entertainment. 

So now we're stuck with the name along with lumping all of the native tribes in the Americas together as ""Indians"", the Irish drunk stereotype along with countless other examples or inappropriate appropriation and misleading but interesting factoids. 

So for things already in the general public's consciousness.. yeah. There is a whole lot of appropriation that is going on that we actually know is wrong.. but people are loathe to change their terminology etc. and it's generally fairly neutral compared to other issues facing an appropriated community. Neutral in terms of direct impact. Still not necessarily right... but tolerable. Sometimes... it's a really really grey area that anybody can justify whatever they want inside of to be honest. 

So into that broiling frothing mix you want an Incan Tattoo. Not ignorantly, like a kid who hasn't been taught about WW2 saying they want a tattoo like their Jewish great grandmothers. But willfully and knowingly. 

If you are Incan, have Incan Anscestry or had the tattoo offered by an Incan tribe as a sign of repect and thanks... that would be fine. 

But you really just like the look. 

So make the aesthetics your own without co-opting the meaning behind them. Think about the things that are important to you and use your own designs and interpretations to express your life. Where you have been, where you are, and where you are going. Then if you still want to use that aesthetic as a template you at least aren't stealing other peoples experiences and claiming them as your own. Some would still claim that doing that is too much cultural appropriation. But yet they won't burn their Beatles records... Hypocrites...

"I was just reading [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/35y0qf/cmv_some_opinions_are_ethically_right_and_can/) where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. 

I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be the most morally correct thing to do, and that the problem is doing it instead, since actually doing it would come with a price that you may not be prepared to pay, therefore saying that the moral thing to do is the opposite.

You might say that in the past century the moral compass has changed and yadda yadda, and we all know that it is simply not true. Morality never changed a bit.

What people are willing to do for morality has changed.

I expect some answers to clarify the concept of ""moral"", and I think it can be stated as ""the most moral action is the one that causes the least possible amount of grief"".","Morality is an abstract human construct and is subject to change, just like language.

principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior.- That's the definition of morality, and different people can see morality in different ways.

Even with your definition, Aztecs practiced human sacrifice, which they saw as causing least amount of grief possible. But since we now know that the sun doesn't run on human sacrifices we can see that what they thought was moral was actually causing more grief than if they didn't practice human sacrifice. ","""Which action causes the least possible amount of grief"" is incredibly subjective, and varies wildly depending on your frame of reference.

Which beings do you consider beings who can be aggrieved? How many people suffering to what extent for how long is worth trading for one other person's wellbeing? For ten people's? For a million people's? 

In the long run, is the most moral action ending humanity because population growth is exponential and you'll prevent the potential suffering of hundreds of billions? Or is it to disappear and kill yourself to remove yourself as a possible cause of grief to and drain on the resources of others?

"The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. If you have a nose that is 2 1/2 inches long and crushed in eye socket, then yes, you have an out. 

However, if you are not disfigured, and your facial syemetry is average, and you are still considered unattractive, well then it's your fault. 

Are you overweight? Your fault. 

Do you dress like a 35 year old male who still lives in his mom's basement, and wears black velcro shoes?  Your fault. 

Are you balding? Depending on the structure of your skull, this is debatable, but you can take steps to mitigate this that don't involve a comb over. Halfway your fault. 

Do you have acne? Take better care of your skin. There are some miracle acne drugs out there. Your fault. 

Do you only wear shit tier clothes every single day because their ""comfortable""? Your fault. 

Do you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you have no concept of fashion? Your fault. 

Do you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you can't afford decent clothes? Work harder, go back to school, still your fault. 

Ladies, do you not wear makeup because it takes too much effort to apply? Your fault. If makeup didn't work there wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar industry surrounding it. 

Do you smell like ass because you don't take a shower every day, use deodorant, and wear cologne/perfume? Your fault. 

Do you have a shit tier job because you have a degree in History? Your fault. 

Men, do you not shave your unibrow/nose hair? Your fault. 

Nearly any excuse you can give for why you are unattractive is something you can control for and therefore makes it your fault. I do not presume to say that taking all these steps will make someone a 10/10 but if you are a 2/10, I firmly believe you can go to a 7/10. Everyone can be a 7/10 out of ten.

Further, what if by claiming entitlement you’re taking away someone else’s freedom? You’re entitled to not want to be someone’s companion. Now that is a real entitlement.

&gt; Single guys suffering deserve as much respect and empathy as women who may face different challenges

Yes and I don’t think anyone denies that.

&gt; Even if the other party isn't interested, it's brave of them and they shouldn't be mocked for their courage

Conversely, it’s cowardly because they did not just make it clear, they waited until the girl developed a bond of friendship, thereby effectively stabbing her in the back when it turns out Mr. Nice Guy wasn’t being a friend, he was just pretending this whole time because he wanted something intimate. 

Considering their approach is the worst approach for both themselves and the counterparty, yes I feel like I should be able to mock their methods.

"Hello CMV,

I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from your basic youth teams) and never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing it was simple as that. By losing and not being rewarded we understood we had to try harder as an individual and try harder as a team to win. This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team.  I really dont understand the idea of rewarding everyone for not winning, it's almost like saying ""hey, even if you dont try you still win"". I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize. To me that just teaches a kid that NOT giving your best will still result in a prize. What lesson does that teach you when you grow up? That your failure or lack of effort will be rewarded regardless of how you performed? Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up? Personally if I had a kid and he/she played a sport I wouldn't allow the coach or a parent to give them a trophy for simply participating, I would make them understand that a reward/trophy is earned by hard work and dedication. I know not all kids are athletic but I still dont understand the concept or idea. 
We all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? Again, I am not trying to sound cold but I just dont understand the concept of rewarding 
failure/losing, CMV......

Edit: thanks for all the answers, feedback and insight. Many of you helped CMV. Again, I hope I didn't come off as cold or inconsiderate. I have younger cousins and love to see them succeed in anything they do, especially sports. I was more interested in having a discussion as to ""why"" and the mentality behind it. Many of you made valid arguments and gave me some great insight. I'm happy to keep discussing if people are interested but please note I am not against the idea but was more interested in helping me change my view of it. If anything please continue to give your children positive feedback, effective communication, motivation and let them know that team work is a great thing. I recommend everyone put their kids in sports (dont push them into it but help and guide them into something they love doing or are very passionate about). It really does pay off when you get older and helps them build some self confidence and understand the dynamics of a social environment. Thanks again everyone! 

Edit 2: Since the discussion continues, I think children under 12 should only get participation Trophies. Once you hit that age you should be teaching your kids the fundamentals of structured team work, effort and the idea that life will not reward your for simply showing up. Giving participation trophies to kids 13 and above is not a good life lesson. If you care to continue CMV on that! 

Edit 3: Thanks everyone for the continued conversation, input, points of views and personal experiences. This sub is great for people who are curious as to get the other sides opinion and everyone should keep an open mind about changing their view on the matter. Now some last bit of advice for coaches and parents who put their kids in sports. PLEASE keep your eye out for the that one un-athletic kid who might not be the best on the team and make sure that his/her team mates understand this is a team event and that everyone is in this together. Some of these personal experiences shared with me shed some light on how people hated playing sports  and were being bulled because they were that kid and the other kids made them feel left out. Not all kids will be good athletes but you can teach your kids to respect one another, support one another and to ensure that they understand the unity of team work. If your kid is that ""all-star"" on the team then make them understand this most because the other kids will look to him/her to see how they treat the rest of the team. A good leader will understand this and this habit will grow with them, you just have to show them how and why. Thanks again for all the input, this is a great sub. ","&gt; never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing.

I find this *so* ironic.  You realize that 2nd place is nothing but the first loser, right?  And 3rd place?.... don't even get me started.

So why are you ok with the first and 2nd losers getting trophies (and, presumably, even accepted them yourself in your youth) but the 3rd loser, 4th loser, 5th loser, etc. get nothing?

In the words of Herm Edwards, you.play.to.win.the.game!  That means there are two categories:  The winner and the losers.  Either you support losers getting trophies or you don't; and if you support *some* losers getting trophies because they are ""better losers"" than other losers, then you're just hypocritical.","So first in that age range those trophies are more mementos and reminders, the only reason I know the years when I played soccer as a kid is those trophies. They're like a stuffed animal you buy at the zoo. That said I do agree we should recognize the winning teams so there is something to play for. I personally like the four trophy type method. There a small trophy for just playing, and then 3rd, 2nd, and 1st get better trophies that increase in awesomeness the higher you place. This way everyone gets a memento, but they still play hard to get the 'best' one they can.

"I believe that it is bad for humans generally that we have patriotism. It leads not only to discrimination. (hello Mr Trump)
But also to economic and political difficulties and misstrust.

It prevents not only people from accepting everyone as their partner in human, but also causes hatred and sometimes war between nations or ethnic groups.

I dont mean that partriotism is worse than no patriotism, but that as a concept and as an element we experience all the time it it in itself bad for us.

(Intrinsic badness versus comparative badness) 

Without patriotism we could form one great community and society. This is prevented by prejudice against others and arrogance about themselves, partiotism conveys.

"I'm not sure at what point people stopped thinking about the ramifications of their actions and became so head strong that they believed they were invincible, that officers judgements were infallible, that their rights would keep the blood inside their body.

I have practiced civil disobedience in my life.  I have been arrested more than once.  But I'll tell you one thing, I have never failed to comply with an officers orders.

I nearly ever incident of a person involved in a police shooting, they have one problem.  They are not being compliant.  The United States offers you rights, but your rights can't keep you alive.  This often turns into a matter of ""you're victim blaming.""  I'm simply saying that right or wrong, the behavior of these victims can most often be described as ""exercising outrageously poor judgement."" 

For one simple reason, I value my life. It's not a matter of principle, it's a matter of practicality.  I don't want to die. And I don't feel sorry for anyone whose ego is bigger than their brain, whether or not their shooting was justified.  

CMV","It seems like you're under the impression that sympathizers believe these victims did nothing wrong. But that's not what they're saying. They're saying the reaction to what the victims did wrong was radically disproportionate, and that if the same scenario occurred with a white person it would have ended differently. 

Let's think of this in terms of three tiers: 1) punishment for the original crime; 2) punishment for resisting arrest or otherwise compounding the original crime; 3) straight up killing the person. Nobody is arguing (well, *most* people are not arguing) against #s 1 or 2. They are arguing against #3 exclusively. There's an acknowledgment that these men did something wrong, and then something wronger, but that neither of those justifies getting shot. For example, Garner earned #1 for selling loose cigarettes, and #2 for swatting away the officer trying to handcuff him (even this is debatable, but I'll let it go for the sake of the bigger issue). But #3 shouldn't have even been on the table. The maneuver used on him wasn't authorized; he didn't need five different officers swarming him. That's the part people are mad about. No one thinks he should have just gotten off entirely. 

Is it a practical reality that they might have avoided death by being entirely submissive? Probably, sure. But most people aren't arguing against that either. Instead, they're arguing that 1) Changes need to be made to alter that practical reality and 2) An altogether *different* practical reality exists for white people. You say that it's not a matter of principle, but the debate you're watching *is* one primarily concerned with principle, as a means to effect a change in practical necessities down the road. Don't think for a second that the black community is somehow unaware of the best practices in dealing with the police, or surprised at what these actions bring on. What we're seeing is just cases where people get particularly scared, or frustrated, or whatever. And sure, their reactions are mistakes, both legally and practically. But they're very, very minor mistakes compared to people who earn their death, like a hostage taker or a mass shooter. 

TL;DR — Having sympathy is distinct from expecting exoneration. You can both acknowledge their wrongdoing and be angry at how their wrongdoing was handled, which is what most people are doing. This controversy is mainly dealing in principle, whether or not principle is important to you.

"Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said:

What happens after the honeymoon period when one person still desires sex, but their partner has lost interest (commonly referred to as a [dead bedroom](http://reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms))?

I think it's still the duty of the disinterested party to at least minimally fulfill the sexual needs of their partner, if sustaining the relationship is a priority. In bullet form, here's why:

* Each partner in the relationship is the others' only source of intimacy and sex (assuming a monogamous relationship), therefore if one partner withholds sex, the physical needs of the other is not being met. What is ultimately a chore or an inconvenience for one partner is a physiological necessity for the other.

* Compromise is fundamentally part of every aspect of a relationship, and sex is no different. I'm conflicted in my thinking on this point: No one should be made to have sex if they don't want to. However, both my SO and I do things for each other that we don't necessarily want to do because it's better for the relationship, or it makes the other happy. I don't believe sex and intimacy should be treated differently- it's reasonable to have expectations of sex as a requirement of the relationship.

The benefits of orgasm can be achieved through masturbation, and the benefits of intimacy can be achieved through cuddling and other intimacy beside sex.

"It all sound the same to me. And to be clear, I know this is what people tend to say about any music they don't ""get."" People say this about rap -- it's just noise, etc. But I like rap, and I think you can make a pretty good argument that there's a ton of variety in rap. From voice to lyrics to production to rhythm, there's really no reason to say Aesop Rock sounds like Mobb Deep, or a track off Illmatic sounds like a Drake mixtape.

I like a lot of types of popular music but don't like punk/hardcore. I looked up hardcore on wikipedia and it seemed like the songs had to fall within a pretty narrow range of genre conventions: short length, driving bass rhythm, simple chords, heavy distortion, shouted lyrics.

So my question is: what does a punk/hardcore fan listen for? What kind of stuff makes a good punk song if the songs are very similar in key respects, or am I missing the boat and there's a lot of variety out there? 

Anyway, I am not trying to be a hater, I'm just out of the loop on this music and its appeal. Thanks.","Are you talking about old-school punk/hardcore, or do you mean the punk/hardcore genre as a whole? You seem to be against 80's hardcore, because lots of 90's and new-school punk is very melodic music made by proficient musicians. As an example, listen to ""Pacific Standard Time"" by No Use For A Name.

But anyways, on to 80's hardcore. While the hallmark of the genre is what you described, there are lots of glaring exceptions. Bad Religion made excellent hardcore punk, yet Graffin never saw the need to shout. Instead, you'll find the singer's grandfatherly voice carrying the song with a catchy melody. If you want an example of this, listen to ""I Want to Conquer the World"".

The importance of lyrics can't be understated. The cornerstone of punk is the message. Even if you can't hear the words, you can usually figure out what the song is railing against, right? I mean, minimalist hip-hop is much the same, if my memory serves me correctly. Word-play and witty lyricism come before making any aurally pleasing backbeat. As an example, here's a little sample of a Bad Religion song ""Going through a word of sad debris/Regard quixotic reveries of ownership/The blossoming disease of man called tenure and accretion, the ancient western treadmill of deception and derision, but I want something more.""

So now we get to to the standard hardcore band. These bands are cabable of creating visceral heaviness with nothing but pure anger. Yet, they still remain accessible and catchy. Example: ""Lights Out"" by the Angry Samoans. The energy s what grabs a lot of people, as far as the genre goes. Some people just can't get enough of the quadruple-time d-beat.

For your homework, listen to ""Out of Step"" by Minor Threat. This is hardcore punk that many people will tell you is the best. I have to agree.

Some of my favorite hardcore albums:

Bad Religion - ""No Control""  
Hot Water Music - ""Fuel For The Hate Game""
Minor Threat - ""Discography"" 
Refused - ""The Shape of Punk to Come""
Husker 	Du - ""Zen Arcade""  

Check any of those out. I would almost suggest listening to more modern or 90's punk bands, as a way to be eased into the genre. NOFX and Against Me! are great places to start. You can work backwards from there. ","Punk music originated amongst people lacking traditional music training and the resources to make professional-sounding music. They were often performing for small groups of people in non-traditional venues.

That is the same as early hip-hop.

Punk music can be made by people with limited talent. But a talented (not trained, talented) guitarist, bassist, drummer and screamer can make short, fast songs that make people excited.

Early punk was only accidentally groundbreaking. Just as Brooklyn kids didn't have full bands for their parties so they used DJs, punks couldn't play well so they turned up the distortion and did the best they could.

But in time, punk evolved. It kept the short, fast and simple style, but there actually are talented singer/songerwriters in punk, as well as great (if not virtuoso) instrumentation.

Compare the DJing of early hip-hop to modern radio hits. It sounds completely different. But that is only because we've listened enough to understand the subtlety. An old fuddy-duddy might say that both Aesop Rock and Mobb Deep are both guys talking over drums and pops.

Would you think it's crazy for me to say that a Black Flag record sounds very different to me than the Misfits. It is loud, sloppy guitars and screamy lyrics, say the fuddy-duddys. True, but I know enough about sloppy guitars and screamy lyrics to know which ones I like and which I don't.

I guess the best metaphor is some people say ""if you've seen one football match, you've seen them all."" There are some similarities, for sure. People running around, kicking balls. But the more you get into football, the more you are able to enjoy it.

I'd like to give you some homework. Listen to ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" by the Ramones. It is like the ""Rapper's Delight"" of Punk. Then listen to ""Last Caress"" by the Misfits. The message of the song is that the singer wants to kill a baby, rape a mother, and kill himself.

Tell me if you think those sound similar. 
",489,"Are you talking about old-school punk/hardcore, or do you mean the punk/hardcore genre as a whole? You seem to be against 80's hardcore, because lots of 90's and new-school punk is very melodic music made by proficient musicians. As an example, listen to ""Pacific Standard Time"" by No Use For A Name.

But anyways, on to 80's hardcore. While the hallmark of the genre is what you described, there are lots of glaring exceptions. Bad Religion made excellent hardcore punk, yet Graffin never saw the need to shout. Instead, you'll find the singer's grandfatherly voice carrying the song with a catchy melody. If you want an example of this, listen to ""I Want to Conquer the World"".

The importance of lyrics can't be understated. The cornerstone of punk is the message. Even if you can't hear the words, you can usually figure out what the song is railing against, right? I mean, minimalist hip-hop is much the same, if my memory serves me correctly. Word-play and witty lyricism come before making any aurally pleasing backbeat. As an example, here's a little sample of a Bad Religion song ""Going through a word of sad debris/Regard quixotic reveries of ownership/The blossoming disease of man called tenure and accretion, the ancient western treadmill of deception and derision, but I want something more.""

So now we get to to the standard hardcore band. These bands are cabable of creating visceral heaviness with nothing but pure anger. Yet, they still remain accessible and catchy. Example: ""Lights Out"" by the Angry Samoans. The energy s what grabs a lot of people, as far as the genre goes. Some people just can't get enough of the quadruple-time d-beat.

For your homework, listen to ""Out of Step"" by Minor Threat. This is hardcore punk that many people will tell you is the best. I have to agree.

Some of my favorite hardcore albums:

Bad Religion - ""No Control""  
Hot Water Music - ""Fuel For The Hate Game""
Minor Threat - ""Discography"" 
Refused - ""The Shape of Punk to Come""
Husker 	Du - ""Zen Arcade""  

Check any of those out. I would almost suggest listening to more modern or 90's punk bands, as a way to be eased into the genre. NOFX and Against Me! are great places to start. You can work backwards from there. ","Punk music originated amongst people lacking traditional music training and the resources to make professional-sounding music. They were often performing for small groups of people in non-traditional venues.

That is the same as early hip-hop.

Punk music can be made by people with limited talent. But a talented (not trained, talented) guitarist, bassist, drummer and screamer can make short, fast songs that make people excited.

Early punk was only accidentally groundbreaking. Just as Brooklyn kids didn't have full bands for their parties so they used DJs, punks couldn't play well so they turned up the distortion and did the best they could.

But in time, punk evolved. It kept the short, fast and simple style, but there actually are talented singer/songerwriters in punk, as well as great (if not virtuoso) instrumentation.

"Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 

1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit whiny, perhaps because is is too close to ""why.""

2. Exclusivity. Only about 300 words in English start with X. Y starts over 700 (per Wolfram-Alpha, and this appears to include proper nouns). X appears in only 0.15% of English words, while Y appears in far more. I could not find an estimated percentage, but so many adverbs end in ""ly"" that it rather proves my point. Even though it's so exclusive, it is so much more versatile, as shown below.

3. Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind. 

4. Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4). 

5. Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable. 

6. Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze. 

7. Sex. Our favorite word not only has X right in it, but the whole last 2/3 of the word sounds like saying X. Y? Nowhere to be found, unless it tags along to make something sexy. Not to mention the uses of XXX, and the fact that fairer sex is made up of X chromosomes. Y gives us baldness, hairy backs, and emotional immaturity. 

8. History. Malcolm X, not Malcolm Y. There's even ""American History X.""

9. Versatility in other areas. X can be used to show that something is crossed out, used as a check mark to indicate the choice on a form, used in cartoons to show that a person is dead, used in medicine (x-rays), used to show treasure on a map, 

10. = X. 

11. ~~No one has ever died in a state spelled with an X. Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, and Wyoming combine for 10% of the deaths in the US each year~~ I somehow came up with the 4 Y states off the top of my head and also thought there were no X states. New Mexico and Texas. 

12. If you're talking about unknown items, you always say ""X is better than Y,"" never ""Y is better than X"". 


EDIT: It worked. I was forced to rethink some of my strongest points. I still may think that X is better, but I can see that Y has its merits and can sometimes be even superior. Very clever responses in many cases, and I'm afraid I'll be banned for giving out too many deltas to people who make me rethink each point.

- She didn't fire Victoria

- Nobody knows why Victoria was fired. It's none of your business anyway

- FPH definitelly wasn't the first time reddit ban a subreddit, harassing and brigading people outside of the sub was always reason for ban, I would like to turn your attention to [this](https://i.imgur.com/A6ORPlL.png). Do you think this is okay? 

- Modtools were like this for ages. The old CEO that is taking her place is having more responsibility for the state of the modtools then Pao ever had 

- She tried to make reddit more advertiser friendly? And this should be like a negative thing? For a CEO? Really?

The vitriol against her was absolutely disgusting with zero base to begin with. Reddit only showed how majority of people here like to bully people. Slow clap guys, you ""did it""

"As more and more people in the developed world are becoming obese, many governments have begun to tax various foods they deem unhealthy because they are allegedly contributing to this epidemic.  While pigovian (no pun intended) taxes of this kind may have been effective for things like alcohol or tobacco, I believe they only work when the tax makes up the majority of the price of the product.  An extra ten cents on his morning can of gravy isn't going to make fatso switch to Slimfast.  

Unfortunately doubling or tripling the price of junk food would completely destroy the market for these things and put manufacturers out of business almost immediately.  This is because there are easy untaxed alternatives to junk food, unlike booze and cigarettes.  Granted you could grow your own tobacco and brew your own beer, but that takes months, while making junk food from tax-free ingredients takes minutes.  Plus if a steak cost the same as a bag of chips people would simply become obese on sirloin rather than Doritos.  
Raising the price of food like this would also be harmful to the poor, especially considering junk food often provides the most calories for your dollar, and is thus essential for many poor people to meet their daily nutritional requirements.  Say what you want about a diet high in fat and sugar, it's still healthier than starvation.

In addition it's grossly unfair to punish everybody when it's only the obese that need to cut back.  Even alcohol and tobacco would be relatively harmless in moderation, but in practice it would be too difficult for a vendor to tell if someone is an alcoholic chain-smoker or if they have self-control.  On the other hand, much to their chagrin, nobody has ever mistaken an obese person for slim, no matter how strong the elastic in their girdle.

Unfortunately if such a system were implemented many fatties would cheat it by having skinny friends or relatives buy their junk food for them.  The only viable solution as I see it would be not to tax food, but rather pants, say by $5-10 per inch the waistline is larger than the inseam.  This would ensure that only the fat would have to pay fat taxes.

Recent examples are-

-the furor this morning (at least on twitter) over Amy Schumer in the WaPo. http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/06/dont-believe-her-defenders-amy-schumers-jokes-are-racist/

-Hannibal Burress had a minor run-in with several notable female twitter personalities including Gaby Dunn. https://twitter.com/hannibalburess/status/618179591140564992 (there's a whole list of responses, if it doesn't show up just go through his timeline)

-Jerry Seinfeld made news when he said he wouldn't play college campuses anymore, to much reminding of his relationship with a 17-year old twenty years ago, and snickering over how his material isn't even edgy anyway. http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/10/living/seinfeld-comedy-colleges-feat/

-Chris Rock said the same thing last year. I guess he's a shitlord too. http://www.vulture.com/2014/11/chris-rock-frank-rich-in-conversation.html

-Patton Oswalt, who at one point was booed in Philly for his anti-Bush beliefs back during 2004 or so, is now not worthy of being followed. He's in a category with Trump and Palin. http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/patton-oswalt-twitter-troll-unfollow/

-Not to pick on Gaby Dunn, but earlier this year she blew up at Josh Groban, because I guess young male celebrities being horndogs is completely new and has never, ever happened in human history. https://storify.com/amandataylor88/don-t-fall-for-this-famous-guy-s-flattery

Hell, even amongst the more notable far-left twitter there's infighting. Suey Park and Lauren Chief Elk are going at it over DMs to an ex/stolen laptops https://twitter.com/suey_park/status/617747933987889152

And depending on who you believe, Rania Khalek is anti-black http://bad-dominicana.tumblr.com/post/87992874258/rania-khalek-such-an-antiblack-piece-of-shit-like or ""bad_dominacana"" is racist against Arabs https://twitter.com/raniakhalek/status/514920026236018688.

I was, am and will be a dyed-in-the-patchouli liberal. I was ecstatic that gays can get married now. I will call Caitlyn Jenner whatever SHE wants me to. I'm a big fan of Bernie Sanders. I absolutely believe all fortysomething of Bill Cosby's accusers.
That said, I'm starting to feel a little lost. I cringe when I see the word ""thinkpiece."" I hate that people get so caught up in a perpetual outrage machine and so high off their own self-righteousness they will destroy a life like Justine Sacco's (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html?_r=0) for sport. (Also, how great is Sam Biddle for basically admitting he'd do it all over again for ""the clickz?"") I have to believe that the right or, ""The Man,"" are absolutely loving this infighting. Endless digital ink is spilled on Black Widow in The Avengers while cops are still shooting anyone with a skin tone darker than Burnt Sienna.

Am I wrong? Am I the asshole here? Is all of this of vital importance? Will the 24/7/365 internet analytical news cycle bring us to the promised land? Or is this just a tool of cultural commentators on a deadline?

EDIT:  I'll add this since I'm getting a lot of advice to get off twitter.  I definitely don't go on as much as I used to, but it's hard for me to stay off completely for two reasons.  One, there's a lot of actually good, funny twitterers out there.  It's also a good news source, it's how I found out we got Bin Laden.  Two, as someone who, despite all warning signs, wants to be involved someday in the comedy/entertainment biz, it's kinda necessary for those on the come up to use it as a promotional tool.  If I was Spielberg or Tarantino I'd get the hell off, trust me.  But I'm a nobody from nowhere at the moment.

Try not to focus on the Twitter thing as much.  There's pieces on Gawker, WaPo and Daily Dot that I've used for examples.  Here's a piece on the AVClub where the writer complains about female fans of Captain Marvel for... reasons.  Not sure.  They're problematic somehow.

http://www.avclub.com/article/marvel-learned-wrong-lessons-carol-corps-218003

EDIT 2:  Not sure how much longer this'll stay active, or how much I'll be able to check in tomorrow so I'll do a pseudo-wrap up here.  I used mainly examples from the comedy world and Twitter since that's what immediately came to mind.  Other examples I could've used were Donglegate (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/) and ScientistShirtgate (http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/11/18/scientist-shirt-feminism-comet-your-say/19248543/).  I think those two, and there are others, are also worthy of discussion in that they involve nuance.  Someone like Donald Trump, that's a black-and-white case of racism.  

Someone in the comments said this seemed like neurotic hand-wringing by an alienated individual, and that could very well be the case.  I didn't really spend a whole lot of time making a comprehensive essay about this because a-it's just reddit and b-I posted from the gut with immediacy.  If someone wants to take this theme and do it up better, by all means go for it.  I never claimed to be a social scientist.  Or even just social.

Some good opinions here, with the major consensus being that these things seem big and important on the internet where everything is a hot take and people are either Lawful Good or Chaotic Evil with no in-between.  So in stepping out from the cyberspace will keep the perspective in check.

Good talk everyone!  No name calling or trolling!

The whole piece is super, super positive towards Oswalt as a comic.

"People seem to feel right now that Sanders is just not well-known enough to even have a chance at the presidency, and that it will stay that way. Everyone has mostly accepted that it will be Clinton vs. some ill-fated Republican, and that Sanders stands no chance. 

I believe this is fully inaccurate, and anyone who believes this must have forgotten what age we are living in. This is the age of the internet, of instant communication, and of viral sensations. The amount of commercials a candidate is able to put themselves on does not determine their chance at winning. From what I've seen in just the past couple of months, Bernie Sanders has a very strong presence on the internet. He's old, but has the progressive ideals and values of most younger Americans. I think his name has been and will be spreading like wildfire over the next 16 months. And that's the other part people are forgetting...we still have a whopping 16 months till the election. That ""Alex from Target"" kid got popular in about a day for no reason whatsoever. Now think about someone who could potentially lead a nation - someone who many people are very passionate about supporting. Sanders will become just as much a household name as other prominent candidate.

**TL;DR - Through the help of the internet and a shitload of time, Bernie Sanders has very good chance at winning this thing.**

"Bernie Sanders is running a campaign on promises like free college and getting money out of politics. Nearly everything I've heard his campaign promise requires congressional action. As a congressman Bernie Sanders knows that.

From the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/26/bernie-sanders-2016_n_7446570.html) : ""Among the specific items on his campaign platform include establishing a $15 minimum wage, closing the gender pay gap, investing $1 trillion over five years to rebuild infrastructure, and overturning the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision""

Each of those things requires new legislation. With 16 years in the House and 2 terms in the Senate Sanders should be familiar with the limits of each branch of government. This makes me think he knows he can't win so he is recklessly promising absurd things. When he inevitably loses and the winning candidate fails to deliver on the impossible goals he set out he can say ""I would have done it differently"" but we should know better. Even if he wins, he'll blame Congress for blocking his agenda. The only way he can possibly accomplish anything he promises is if 1) He wins the presidential election, 2) Like-minded democrats win a majority in BOTH houses of congress. Which, while it would be cool, is only possible in some incredibly unlikely fantasy land.

"This is not meant to be a troll post, but an earnest attempt to determine if my views are incorrect or unfair.  I have two minds when it comes to the fact that so many people have trouble finding a job that pays a living wage and is something they enjoy.  On one hand I am very sympathetic and feel that I have been lucky in life to get to where I am.  On the other hand I got to where I am through taking calculated risks and then stacking the deck in my favor.  There was definitely luck involved, but not all the risks I took paid out and I had to move on to something else.  I feel like too many people aren't taking matters into their own hands regarding their own success, like I feel I did, and I simultaneously feel proud and callous in that belief.  I am unsure which one is more correct.

Example #1

I have been on the recruiting side of multiple companies (tech sector) and have been blown away by the low quality/behavior of applicants.  These are the people that get through the resume filter and are invited on site.  Now I never test applicants on specific details of systems, because in practice you look those up as needed on the job.  I asked about what they have done in the past or what parts of their training they were most familiar with and tested their understanding of it.  I have had people that came into interviews and tried to act like they were running the show, people who refused to answer questions I asked, and people not familiar with the most basic parts of what they said they were experts in.  I know this is anecdotal, but the fact that it was so difficult to find people that were remotely qualified in fields they had spent years studying completely confused me.  The bar for applicants was not high in most cases my team was very motivated to find someone to hire.  I could not understand why people seemed to put in so little effort to sell themselves.
 
Example #2

I once worked for many years at a company that was funded off of venture capital around '08, where all investors closed up shop.  There was a lot of pressure on the company and there were multiple mass layoffs that cut staff to the bone and then even further.  I survived all of them, and eventually resigned because I correctly predicted the company would fold in a month.  I was fully aware of the risk of me losing my job and I countered that by simply being very useful.  This was a win-win scenario, because I was an enthusiastic employee and was happy to improve my skills through working on any existing part of the system or try to develop new ones.  Because of this I was more valuable than most of the other employees and had a ton of work/learning experiences I could talk about with recruiters.  Anyone on the team that was remotely difficult to deal with got cut, and I saw their downfall much earlier than it happened.  Now if everyone is being the star employee it would be a different but I have never found a group where that is the case.  For any individual on a team, you don't have to work more hours than someone else to be more valuable than them; you just need to be more friendly, cooperative, and effective.  In my experience that just requires effort and not any special creativity.

Example #3

I started off with a lot of bad habits that inhibited my professional development.  I am very stubborn, so I tend to go down the wrong path for quite a while before I accept that it is wrong.  Despite that, I always honestly evaluated why other people were more effective employees/professionals than me.  In those cases, I would take a step back, forget my ego, and ask myself what they were doing that I was not.  I'd talk to close friends about this to analyze my conclusions and when I figured out what they were doing better I would work incorporate that into myself.  It seemed much easier to mimic the habits of successful people rather than come up with the behaviors on my own.  The fact that I don't see a lot of people doing this completely baffles me.

My experience has been limited to the tech sector but I don't see why this wouldn't generalize to other fields.  Now there are certainly fields where the supply of people overtakes the demand, but I were in that position I would give it my best shot and if it didn't work out I'd move on to something else.  Please tell me if I'm wrong.

edit: from a lot of the comments, I would like to clarify that I did not mean immediate success.  Rather, that one can be driven and follow a path that eventually does not pan out, but that being drive will eventually lead one to success.

"Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. While fear of extermination would indeed be justified in 1930s Europe, fear of extermination by Islamic terrorists continues today even in Canada and the US. I've even heard that ISIS is going to exterminate the Jews, even though ISIS has not killed a single Jewish person to this date.

There is a widely-held view in Jewish circles that the UN is inherently anti-Semitic even though the majority of permanent members of the UN Security Council are very pro-Israel. UN troops never interfere with Israeli military operations and one of the first UN resolutions was the establishment of the State of Israel. Still, extremist groups like the JDL (Jewish Defence League) attract support from mainstream Jewish organizations, despite their classification as a terrorist group.

The Jewish community seems to think that their politicians at home persecute them as well. I know so many liberal Jews who will vote for a right-wing party just because they scream their unwavering support for Israel the loudest. Currently, every single major candidate running for President of the United States or Prime Minister of Canada has declared their staunch support for Israel; even left-wingers like Bernie Sanders and Canada's frontrunner Tom Mulcair.

Meanwhile, white cops are killing black kids at a horrifying rate but the Jewish community is still focused on their own supposed persecution. When the Charleston shooting broke out, my synagogue had one moment of silence then continued with its Israel fundraiser. My theory is that North American Jewish culture has developed an irrational persecution complex due to past persecution ritualistically retold every Hanukkah, Passover, Purim, Yom Ha'Shoah, etc. I realize this may come off as anti-Semetic and indeed my own family has called me a ""self-hating Jew"", although I think this only reinforces my point. Will someone change my view?","You've developed a theory based on your own family and community, and anecdotes from some national figures and events. But the question is, does the theory represent the majority of North American Jews.

In my experience it does not, and I also see plenty of national figures that support my position, such as for example [Chomky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky#Political_views), Jon Stewart, [Schulman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Schulman#Activism), etc.; Jews are very active in the BDS movement; and there is of course [J Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Street) and so forth.

Why is your experience different from mine? Well, you mentioned ""my synagogue."" It is very possible that your theory is right about more religious Jews, but a lot of Jews in the US are non-religious and never or almost never go to a synagogue. They are also much less supportive of Israel and far less likely to think Jews are persecuted.

You might be right that the Jewish **religion** focuses a lot on persecution of Jews (which makes sense, it's how Jews survived), but it simply is [not a big factor in the lives of many or most Jews in North America today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews#Observances_and_engagement): Even of Jews that consider themselves ""strongly connected"" to the Jewish religion, less than half belong to a synagogue. And more and more Jews just don't care about religion, considering themselves only ""culturally Jewish"", 20% in 1990 to 37% in 2008, and by now that number is even higher.
","You have to remember that many Jews alive today were actively persecuted and discriminated against in North America. By chance I just just finished reading an article about Jon Stewart where he describes being bullied for his religion as a child. Clubs still excluded Jewish members and Jews were still treated as very much separate from the rest of society. People who grew up in the 50s, 60s and 70s still faced a fair amount of discrimination as children and younger adults and it's not unreasonable to be affected by that. That makes feelings of persecution entirely rational.",498,"You have to remember that many Jews alive today were actively persecuted and discriminated against in North America.

"A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of $500 on fireworks.  I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but after a few minutes, what else is there but more of the same?

But this private display, ergh.  One, two, three tubes, willows, spinners, blah blah blah.  An hour and a half of this?  I got good and buzzed, and gave myself time to sober up, and still it went on and on and on.  No pace, no art, just whistle, bang, pretty lights.  And I drove home, and saw dozens of similar displays, all the same.  

These people are just enjoying the bang and zoom and pretty lights, they are not commemorating anything.  And I've seen all kinds of stories, people injured, even killed, by these things, which in my opinion offer little or no excitement or entertainment.

It's important to keep in mind though, if you ever find yourself working with different chemicals, making fireworks or shooting them, they absolutely do deserve the same respect to safety as guns or any other dangerous activity","This is a very subjective view. For you, fireworks may not offer much excitement so the risks of physical harm may not be worth the monetary cost or potential danger. However, you must recognize that there are many things which you may find boring but another person may find very entertaining.

For another person, fireworks may be the shit. They may spend all day and all night fantasizing about them. They may spontaneously orgasm every 4th of July for 5 hours gazing up at the sky. I personally don't understand how people enjoy birdwatching, either, but there's plenty of people who do. You can't possibly quantify what other people like.

For the people that enjoy fireworks and fireworks shows, the relatively small risk (if you handle them properly) compared to the enjoyment they get from the experience is worth it for them. They are paying for a night which they hold fond in their memories, a sense of wonder, a feeling of pleasure. You may not understand it and may even consider it a waste of time and resources, but that's OK. No one is holding a firecracker to your head and making you enjoy it.

Also, as a personal anecdote, this isn't terribly uncommon. It seems people either love fireworks or hate them. I personally love them, but only when I'm the one lighting them.
