This is the changing of gender roles so much that the two genders become indistinguishable and gender no longer matters. In such a world, transgender people would feel entirely comfortable because there would be no expectations attached to their genitalia. However, with our current society and biology, such a world is a long way off. \\n\\nTransgender people are for the most part not changing their gender. They were born with a particular sex, yet this does not match their actual internal gender. Coming out is basically admitting to the world that your mental gender differs from your physical sex, in the same way that people who are coming out as gay are not changing their sexual orientation. They were always gay. Transgender people were always the same gender inside, but they simply did not admit it to the world.'"
