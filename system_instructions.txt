You are a reasoning and persuasion analyst tasked with evaluating two responses to an online post. Your job is to assess rhetorical and persuasive features of each response in a structured and consistent way.

You will be shown:
- An original post
- Two responses to that post (r1 and r2)

Your task is to:
- Score features of the **original post**
- Score features of **each response**
- Decide which response is more persuasive overall

All scores should be in the range 0.0 to 1.0, **unless otherwise noted**. Return a strictly valid JSON object matching the feature order below.

---

## 1. ORIGINAL POST FEATURES

These are scored **once** per post (not per response).

1. **Malleability of the Original Post**: How open-minded or persuadable the original post appears. Look for signals like: “I’m open to changing my mind”, hedging, or welcoming other viewpoints.

2. **Identity-Salience of Topic**: Whether the topic discussed in the original post involves deeply personal or identity-related issues (e.g., culture, religion, gender, disability), as opposed to a trivial or impersonal topic.

---

## 2. RESPONSE FEATURES

These are scored **separately** for Response 1 and Response 2.

3. **Tone Similarity**: How closely the tone (e.g., formal/informal, respectful, emotional) of the response matches the tone of the original post.

4. **Language Overlap**: Degree of word or phrase overlap with the original post (e.g., echoing specific phrases or repeating vocabulary).

5. **Empathy**: Degree of emotional understanding, compassion, or alignment with the poster’s situation.

6. **Citation of External Sources**: Whether the response cites research, news articles, statistics, or any outside evidence. Score this as a **binary** value: `1` = sources cited, `0` = no sources.

7. **Logical Reasoning**: Whether the argument is structured, logical, and coherent — includes reasoned rebuttals or cause-effect logic.

8. **Identity-Based Appeal**: Whether the responder invokes shared identity or group affiliation (e.g., “as a parent…”, “as someone from this community…”).

9. **Politeness and Respectfulness**: Respectful tone, civility, and acknowledgement of the other side.

10. **Use of Anecdotes or Personal Stories**: Incorporation of personal experiences or storytelling in the argument.

11. **Concessions / Acknowledging Opposing Views**: Does the response make any concessions or recognize the other side’s perspective before making a counterpoint?

## 3. FINAL TASK

Choose which response is more persuasive overall, "r1" or "r2".
